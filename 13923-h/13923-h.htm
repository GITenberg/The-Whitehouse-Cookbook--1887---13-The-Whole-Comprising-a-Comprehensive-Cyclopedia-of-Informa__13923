<h2>PUBLISHERS' PREFACE</h2>
<br>
<p>In presenting to the public the "WHITE HOUSE COOK BOOK," the
publishers believe they can justly claim that it more fully
represents the progress and present perfection of the culinary art
than any previous work. In point of authorship, it stands
pre&euml;minent. Hugo Ziemann was at one time caterer for that
Prince Napoleon who was killed while fighting the Zulus in Africa.
He was afterwards steward of the famous Hotel Splendide in Paris.
Later he conducted the celebrated Brunswick Caf&eacute; in New
York, and still later he gave to the Hotel Richelieu, in Chicago, a
cuisine which won the applause of even the gourmets of foreign
lands. It was here that he laid the famous "spread" to which the
chiefs of the warring factions of the Republican Convention sat
down in June, 1888, and from which they arose with asperities
softened, differences harmonized and victory organized.</p>
<p>Mrs. F.L. Gillette is no less proficient and capable, having
made a life-long and thorough study of cookery and housekeeping,
especially as adapted to the practical wants of average American
homes.</p>
<p>The book has been prepared with great care. Every recipe has
been <i>tried</i> and <i>tested</i>, and can be relied upon as one
of the <i>best</i> of its kind. It is comprehensive, filling
completely, it is believed, the requirements of housekeepers of all
classes. It embodies several original and commendable features,
among which may be mentioned the <i>menus</i> for the holidays and
for one week in each month in the year, thus covering all varieties
of seasonable foods; the convenient classification and arrangement
of topics; the simplified method of explanation in preparing an
article, in the order of manipulation, thereby enabling the most
inexperienced to clearly comprehend it.</p>
<p>The subject of carving has been given a prominent place, not
only because of its special importance in a work of this kind, but
particu<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span><a name='Page_4' id=
"Page_4"></a>larly because it contains entirely new and original
designs, and is so far a departure from the usual mode of treating
the subject.</p>
<p>Interesting information is given concerning the <i>White
House</i>; how its hospitality is conducted, the menus served on
special occasions, views of the interior, portraits of all the
ladies of the White House, etc.</p>
<p>Convenience has been studied in the make-up of the book. The
type is large and plain; it is sewed by patent flexible process, so
that when opened it will not close of itself, and it is bound in
enameled cloth, adapted for use in the kitchen.</p>

<a name='CARVING' id="CARVING"></a>
<h2>CARVING.</h2>
<br>
<p>Carving is one important acquisition in the routine of daily
living, and all should try to attain a knowledge or ability to do
it well, and withal gracefully.</p>
<p>When carving use a chair slightly higher than the ordinary size,
as it gives a better purchase on the meat, and appears more
graceful than when standing, as is often quite necessary when
carving a turkey, or a very large joint. More depends on skill than
strength. The platter should be placed opposite, and sufficiently
near to give perfect command of the article to be carved, the knife
of medium size, sharp with a keen edge. Commence by cutting the
slices thin, laying them carefully to one side of the platter, then
afterwards placing the desired amount on each guest's plate, to be
served in turn by the servant.</p>
<p>In carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect
flakes; for if these are broken the beauty of the fish is lost. The
carver should acquaint himself with the choicest parts and morsels;
and to give each guest an equal share of those <i>tidbits</i>
should be his maxim. Steel knives and forks should on no account be
used in helping fish, as these are liable to impart a <i>very</i>
disagreeable flavor. A fish-trowel of silver or plated silver is
the proper article to use.</p>
<p>Gravies should be sent to the table very <i>hot</i>, and in
helping one to gravy or melted butter, place it on a vacant side of
the plate, not <i>pour</i> it over their meat, fish or fowl, that
they may use only as much as they like.</p>
<p>When serving fowls, or meats, accompanied with stuffing, the
guests should be asked if they would have a portion, as it is not
every one to whom the flavor of stuffing is agreeable; in filling
their plates, avoid heaping one thing upon another, as it makes a
bad appearance.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span><a name='Page_8' id=
"Page_8"></a>
<p>A word about the care of carving knives: a fine steel knife
should not come in contact with intense heat, because it destroys
its temper, and therefore impairs its cutting qualities. Table
carving knives should not be used in the kitchen, either around the
stove, or for cutting bread, meats, vegetables, etc.; a fine
whetstone should be kept for sharpening, and the knife cleaned
carefully to avoid dulling its edge, all of which is quite
essential to successful carving.</p>

off before the carcass is split open down the back. French chops
are a small rib chop, the end of the bone trimmed off and the meat
and fat cut away from the thin end, leaving the round piece of meat
attached to the larger end, which leaves the small rib-bone bare.
Very tender and sweet.</p>
<p>Mutton is <i>prime</i> when cut from a carcass which has been
fed out of doors, and allowed to run upon the hillside; they are
best when about three years old. The fat will then be abundant,
white and hard, the flesh juicy and firm, and of a clear red
color.</p>
<p>For mutton roasts, choose the shoulder, the saddle, or the loin
or haunch. The leg should be boiled. Almost any part will do for
broth.</p>
<p>Lamb born in the middle of the winter, reared under shelter, and
fed in a great measure upon milk, then killed in the spring, is
considered a great delicacy, though lamb is good at a year old.
Like all young animals, lamb ought to be thoroughly cooked, or it
is most unwholesome.</p>

<p><b>PORK.</b></p>
<p>No. 1. Leg, used for smoked hams, roasts and corned pork.</p>
<p>No. 2. Hind-loin, used for roasts, chops and baked dishes.</p>
<p>No. 3. Fore-loin or ribs, used for roasts, baked dishes or
chops.</p>
<p>No. 4. Spare-rib, used for roasts, chops, stews.</p>
<p>No. 5. Shoulder, used for smoked shoulder, roasts and corned
pork.</p>
<p>No. 6. Brisket and flank, used for pickling in salt and smoked
bacon.</p>
<p>The cheek is used for pickling in salt, also the shank or shin.
The feet are usually used for souse and jelly.</p>
<p>For family use the leg is the most economical, that is when
fresh, and the loin the richest. The best pork is from carcasses
weighing from fifty to about one hundred and twenty-five pounds.
Pork is a white and close meat, and it is almost impossible to
over-roast or cook it too much; when underdone it is exceedingly
unwholesome.</p>

<p><b>VENISON.</b></p>
<p>No. 1. Shoulder, used for roasting; it may be boned and stuffed,
then afterwards baked or roasted.</p>
<p>No. 2. Fore-loin, used for roasts and steaks.</p>
<p>No. 3. Haunch or loin, used for roasts, steaks, stews. The ribs
cut close may be used for soups. Good for pickling and making into
smoked venison.</p>
<p>No. 4. Breast, used for baking dishes, stewing.</p>
<p>No. 5. Scrag or neck, used for soups.</p>
<br>
<p>The choice of venison should be judged by the fat, which, when
the venison is young, should be thick, clear and close, and the
meat a very dark red. The flesh of a female deer about four years
old, is the sweetest and best of venison.</p>
<p>Buck venison, which is in season from June to the end of
September, is finer than doe venison, which is in season from
October to December. Neither should be dressed at any other time of
year, and no meat requires so much care as venison in killing,
preserving and dressing.</p>

<p><b>SIRLOIN OF BEEF.</b></p>
<p>This choice roasting-piece should be cut with one good firm
stroke from end to end of the joint, at the upper part, in thin,
long, even slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, cutting
across the grain, serving each guest with some of the fat with the
lean; this may be done by cutting a small, thin slice from
underneath the bone from 5 to 6, through the tenderloin.</p>
<p>Another way of carving this piece, and which will be of great
assistance in doing it well, is to insert the knife just above the
bone at the bottom, and run sharply along, dividing the meat from
the bone at the bottom and end, thus leaving it perfectly flat;
then carve in long, thin slices the usual way. When the bone has
been removed and the sirloin rolled before it is cooked, it is laid
upon the platter on one end, and an even, thin slice is carved
across the grain of the upper surface.</p>
<p>Roast ribs should be carved in thin, even slices from the thick
end towards the thin in the same manner as the sirloin; this can be
more easily and cleanly done if the carving knife is first run
along between the meat and the end and rib-bones, thus leaving it
free from bone to be cut into slices.</p>
<p><i>Tongue</i>.&mdash;To carve this it should be cut crosswise,
the middle being the best; cut in very <i>thin</i> slices, thereby
improving its delicacy, making it more tempting; as is the case of
all well-carved meats. The root of the tongue is usually left on
the platter.</p>

<p><b>BREAST OF VEAL.</b></p>
<p>This piece is quite similar to a fore-quarter of lamb after the
shoulder has been taken off. A breast of veal consists of two
parts, the rib-bones and the gristly brisket. These parts may be
separated by sharply passing the carving knife in the direction of
the line from 1 to 2; and when they are entirely divided, the
rib-bones should be carved in the direction of the line from 5 to
6, and the brisket can be helped by cutting slices from 3 to 4.</p>
<p>The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference
for the brisket or ribs; and if there be a sweetbread served with
the dish, as is frequently with this roast of veal, each person
should receive a piece.</p>
<p>Though veal and lamb contain less nutrition than beef and
mutton, in proportion to their weight, they are often preferred to
these latter meats on account of their delicacy of texture and
flavor. A whole breast of veal weighs from nine to twelve
pounds.</p>

<p><b>A FILLET OF VEAL.</b></p>
<p>A fillet of veal is one of the prime roasts of veal; it is taken
from the leg above the knuckle; a piece weighing from ten to twelve
pounds is a good size and requires about four hours for roasting.
Before roasting, it is dressed with a force meat or stuffing placed
in the cavity from where the bone was taken out and the flap
tightly secured together with skewers; many bind it together with
tape.</p>
<p>To carve it, cut in even thin slices off from the whole of the
upper part or top, in the same manner as from a rolled roast of
beef, as in the direction of the figs. 1 and 2; this gives the
person served some of the dressing with each slice of meat.</p>
<p>Veal is very unwholesome unless it is cooked thoroughly, and
when roasted should be of a rich brown color. Bacon, fried pork,
sausage-balls, with greens, are among the accompaniments of roasted
veal, also a cut lemon.</p>

title=''></center>
<p><b>NECK OF VEAL.</b></p>
<p>The best end of a neck of veal makes a very good roasting-piece;
it, however, is composed of bone and ribs that make it quite
difficult to carve, unless it is done properly. To attempt to carve
each chop and serve it, you would not only place <i>too</i> large a
piece upon the plate of the person you intend to serve, but you
would waste much time, and should the vertebr&aelig; have not been
removed by the butcher, you would be compelled to exercise such a
degree of strength that would make one's appearance very
ungraceful, and possibly, too, throwing gravy over your neighbor
sitting next to you. The correct way to carve this roast is to cut
diagonally from fig. 1 to 2, and help in slices of moderate
thickness; then it may be cut from 3 to 4, in order to separate the
small bones; divide and serve them, having first inquired if they
are desired.</p>
<p>This joint is usually sent to the table accompanied by bacon,
ham, tongue, or pickled pork, on a separate dish and with a cut
lemon on a plate. There are also a number of sauces that are
suitable with this roast.</p>

<p><b>LEG OF MUTTON.</b></p>
<p>The best mutton, and that from which most nourishment is
obtained is that of sheep from three to six years old, and which
have been fed on dry, sweet pastures; then mutton is in its
<i>prime</i>, the flesh being firm, juicy, dark colored and full of
the richest gravy. When mutton is two years old, the meat is
flabby, pale and savorless.</p>
<p>In carving a roasted leg, the best slices are found by cutting
quite down to the bone, in the direction from 1 to 2, and slices
may be taken from either side.</p>
<p>Some very good cuts are taken from the broad end from 5 to 6,
and the fat on this ridge is very much liked by many. The
cramp-bone is a delicacy, and is obtained by cutting down to the
bone at 4, and running the knife under it in a semicircular
direction to 3. The nearer the knuckle the drier the meat, but the
under side contains the most finely grained meat, from which slices
may be cut lengthwise. When sent to the table a frill of paper
around the knuckle will improve its appearance.</p>

<p><b>FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.</b></p>
<p>The first cut to be made in carving a fore-quarter of lamb is to
separate the shoulder from the breast and ribs; this is done by
passing a sharp carving knife lightly around the dotted line as
shown by the figs. 3, 4 and 5, so as to cut through the skin, and
then, by raising with a little force the shoulder, into which the
fork should be firmly fixed, it will easily separate with just a
little more cutting with the knife; care should be taken not to cut
away too much of the meat from the breast when dividing the
shoulder from it, as that would mar its appearance. The shoulder
may be placed upon a separate dish for convenience. The next
process is to divide the ribs from the brisket by cutting through
the meat in the line from 1 to 2; then the ribs may be carved in
the direction of the line 6 to 7, and the brisket from 8 to 9. The
carver should always ascertain whether the guest prefers ribs,
brisket, or a piece of the shoulder.</p>

title=''></center>
<p><b>HAM.</b></p>
<p>The carver in cutting a ham must be guided according as he
desires to practice economy, or have at once fine slices out of the
prime part. Under the first supposition, he will commence at the
knuckle end, and cut off thin slices toward the thick and upper
part of the ham.</p>
<p>To reach the choicer portion of the ham, the knife, which must
be very sharp and thin, should be carried quite down to the bone
through the thick fat in the direction of the line from 1 to 2. The
slices should be even and thin, cutting both lean and fat together,
always cutting down to the bone. Some cut a circular hole in the
middle of a ham gradually enlarging it outwardly. Then again many
carve a ham by first cutting from 1 to 2, then across the other way
from 3 to 4. Remove the skin after the ham is cooked and send to
the table with dots of dry pepper or dry mustard on the top, a tuft
of fringed paper twisted about the knuckle, and plenty of fresh
parsley around the dish. This will always insure an inviting
appearance.</p>
<p><i>Roast Pig</i>.&mdash;The modern way of serving a pig is not
to send it to the table whole, but have it carved partially by the
cook; first, by dividing the shoulder from the body; then the leg
in the same manner; also separating the ribs into convenient
portions. The head may be divided and placed on the same platter.
To be served as hot as possible.</p>
<p>A Spare Rib of Pork is carved by cutting slices from the fleshy
part, after which the bones should be disjointed and separated.</p>
<p>A leg of pork may be carved in the same manner as a ham.</p>

'HAUNCH OF VENISON' title=''></center>
<p><b>HAUNCH OF VENISON</b></p>
<p>A haunch of venison is the <i>prime</i> joint, and is carved
very similar to almost any roasted or boiled leg; it should be
first cut crosswise down to the bone following the line from 1 to
2; then turn the platter with the knuckle farthest from you, put in
the point of the knife, and cut down as far as you can, in the
directions shown by the dotted lines from 3 to 4; then there can be
taken out as many slices as is required on the right and left of
this. Slices of venison should be cut thin, and gravy given with
them, but as there is a special sauce made with red wine and
currant jelly to accompany this meat, do not serve gravy before
asking the guest if he pleases to have any.</p>
<p>The fat of this meat is like mutton, apt to cool soon, and
become hard and disagreeable to the palate; it should, therefore,
be served always on warm plates, and the platter kept over a
hot-water dish, or spirit lamp. Many cooks dish it up with a white
paper frill pinned around the knuckle bone.</p>
<p>A haunch of mutton is carved the same as a haunch of
venison.</p>

<p><b>TURKEY.</b></p>
<p>A turkey having been relieved from strings and skewers used in
trussing should be placed on the table with the head or neck at the
carver's right hand. An expert carver places the fork in the
turkey, and does not remove it until the whole is divided. First
insert the fork firmly in the lower part of the breast, just
forward of fig. 2, then sever the legs and wings on both sides, if
the whole is to be carved, cutting neatly through the joint next to
the body, letting these parts lie on the platter. Next, cut
downward from the breast from 2 to 3, as many even slices of the
white meat as may be desired, placing the pieces neatly on one side
of the platter. Now unjoint the legs and wings at the middle joint,
which can be done very skillfully by a little practice. Make an
opening into the cavity of the turkey for dipping out the inside
dressing, by cutting a piece from the rear part 1, 1, called the
apron. Consult the tastes of the guests as to which part is
preferred; if no choice is expressed, serve a portion of both light
and dark meat. One of the most delicate parts of the turkey are two
little muscles, lying in small dish-like cavities on each side of
the back, a little behind the leg attachments; the next most
delicate meat fills the cavities in the neck bone, and next to
this, that on the second joints. The lower part of the leg (or
drumstick, as it is called) being hard, tough and stringy, is
rarely ever helped to any one, but allowed to remain on the
dish.</p>

title=''></center>
<p><b>ROAST GOOSE.</b></p>
<p>To carve a goose, first begin by separating the leg from the
body, by putting the fork into the small end of the limb, pressing
it closely to the body, then passing the knife under at 2, and
turning the leg back as you cut through the joint. To take off the
wing, insert the fork in the small end of the pinion, and press it
close to the body; put the knife in at fig. 1, and divide the
joint. When the legs and wings are off, the breast may be carved in
long, even slices, as represented in the lines from 1 to 2. The
back and lower side bones, as well as the two lower side bones by
the wing, may be cut off; but the best pieces of the goose are the
breast and thighs, after being separated from the drumsticks. Serve
a little of the dressing from the inside, by making a circular
slice in the apron at fig. 3. A goose should never be over a year
old; a tough goose is very difficult to carve, and certainly most
difficult to eat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FOWLS.</b></p>
<p>First insert the knife between the leg and the body, and cut to
the bone; then turn the leg back with the fork, and if the fowl is
tender the joint will give away easily. The wing is broken off the
same way, only dividing the joint with the knife, in the direction
from 1 to 2. The four quarters having been removed in this way,
take off the merry-thought and the neck-bones; these last are to be
removed by putting the knife in at figs. 3 and 4, pressing it hard,
when they will break off from the part that sticks to the breast.
To separate the breast from the body of the fowl, cut through the
tender ribs close to the breast, quite down to the tail. Now turn
the fowl over, back upwards; put the knife into the bone midway
between the neck and the rump, and on raising the lower end it will
separate readily. Turn now the rump from you, and take off very
neatly the two side bones, and the fowl is carved. In separating
the thigh from the drumstick, the knife must be inserted exactly at
the joint, for if not accurately hit, some difficulty will be
experienced to get them apart; this is easily acquired by practice.
There is no difference in carving roast and <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span><a name='Page_24' id="Page_24"></a>boiled
fowls if full grown; but in very young fowls the breast is usually
served whole; the wings and breast are considered the best parts,
but in young ones the legs are the most juicy. In the case of a
capon or large fowl, slices may be cut off at the breast, the same
as carving a pheasant.</p>
<br>
<center><img src='images/024.png' width='600' height='105' alt=''
title=''></center>
<p><b>ROAST DUCK.</b></p>
<p>A young duckling may be carved in the same manner as a fowl, the
legs and wings being taken off first on either side. When the duck
is full size, carve it like a goose; first cutting it in slices
from the breast, beginning close to the wing and proceeding upward
towards the breast bone, as is represented by the lines 1 to 2. An
opening may be made by cutting out a circular slice, as shown by
the dotted lines at number 3.</p>
<p>Some are fond of the feet, and when dressing the duck, these
should be neatly skinned and never removed. Wild duck is highly
esteemed by epicures; it is trussed like a tame duck, and carved in
the same manner, the breast being the choicest part.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PARTRIDGES.</b></p>
<p>Partridges are generally cleaned and trussed the same way as a
pheasant, but the custom of cooking them with the heads on is going
into disuse somewhat. The usual way of carving them is similar to a
pigeon, dividing it into two equal parts. Another method is to cut
it into three pieces, by severing a wing and leg on either side
from the body, by following the lines 1 to 2, thus making two
servings of those parts, leaving the breast for a third plate. The
third method is to thrust back the body from the legs, and cut
through the middle of the breast, thus making four portions that
may be served. Grouse and prairie-chicken are carved from the
breast when they are large, and quartered or halved when of medium
size.</p>

title=''></center>
<p><b>PHEASANT.</b></p>
<p>Place your fork firmly in the centre of the breast of this large
game bird and cut deep slices to the bone at figs. 1 and 2; then
take off the leg in the line from 3 and 4, and the wing 3 and 5,
severing both sides the same. In taking off the wings, be careful
not to cut too near the neck; if you do you will hit upon the
neck-bone, from which the wing must be separated. Pass the knife
through the line 6, and under the merry-thought towards the neck,
which will detach it. Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast,
wings and merry-thought of a pheasant are the most highly prized,
although the legs are considered very finely flavored. Pheasants
are frequently roasted with the head left on; in that case, when
dressing them, bring the head round under the wing, and fix it on
the point of a skewer.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PIGEONS.</b></p>
<p>A very good way of carving these birds is to insert the knife at
fig. 1, and cut both ways to 2 and 3, when each portion may be
divided into two pieces, then served. Pigeons, if not too large,
may be cut in halves, either across or down the middle, cutting
them into two equal parts; if young and small they may be served
entirely whole.</p>
<p>Tame pigeons should be cooked as soon as possible after they are
killed, as they very quickly lose their flavor. Wild pigeons, on
the contrary, should hang a day or two in a cool place before they
are dressed. Oranges cut into halves are used as a garnish for
dishes of small birds, such as pigeons, quail, woodcock, squabs,
snipe, etc. These small birds are either served whole or split down
the back, making two servings.</p>

<p><b>MACKEREL.</b></p>
<p>The mackerel is one of the most beautiful of fish, being known
by its silvery whiteness. It sometimes attains to the length of
twenty inches, but usually, when fully grown, is about fourteen or
sixteen inches long, and about two pounds in weight. To carve a
baked mackerel, first remove the head and tail by cutting downward
at 1 and 2; then split them down the back, so as to serve each
person a part of each side piece. The roe should be divided in
small pieces and served with each piece of fish. Other whole fish
may be carved in the same manner. The fish is laid upon a little
sauce or folded napkin, on a hot dish, and garnished with
parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED SALMON.</b></p>
<p>This fish is seldom sent to the table whole, being <i>too</i>
large for any ordinary sized family; the middle cut is considered
the choicest to boil. To carve it, first run the knife down and
along the upper side of the fish from 1 to 2, then again on the
lower side from 3 to 4. Serve the thick part, cutting it lengthwise
in slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, and the thin
part breadthwise, or in the direction from 5 to 6. A slice of the
thick with one of the thin, where lies the fat, should be served to
each guest. Care should be taken when carving not to break the
flakes of the fish, as that impairs its appearance. The flesh of
the salmon is rich and delicious in flavor. Salmon is in season
from the first of February to the end of August.</p>

<a name='SOUPS' id="SOUPS"></a>
<h2><b>SOUPS.</b></h2>
<p>Consomm&eacute;, or Stock, forms the basis of all meat soups,
and also of all principal sauces. It is, therefore, essential to
the success of these culinary operations to know the most complete
and economical method of extracting from a certain quantity of meat
the best possible stock or broth. Fresh, uncooked beef makes the
best stock, with the addition of cracked bones, as the glutinous
matter contained in them renders it important that they should be
boiled with the meat, which adds to the strength and thickness of
the soup. They are composed of an earthy substance&mdash;to which
they owe their solidity&mdash;of gelatine, and a fatty fluid,
something like marrow. <i>Two ounces</i> of them contain as much
gelatine as <i>one pound</i> of meat; but, in them, this is so
encased in the earthy substance, that boiling water can dissolve
only the surface of the whole bones, but by breaking them they can
be dissolved more. When there is an abundance of it, it causes the
stock, when cold, to become a jelly. The flesh of old animals
contains more flavor than the flesh of young ones. Brown meats
contain more flavor than white.</p>
<p>Mutton is too strong in flavor for good stock, while veal,
although quite glutinous, furnishes very little nutriment.</p>
<p>Some cooks use meat that has once been cooked; this renders
little nourishment and destroys the flavor. It might answer for
ready soup, but for stock to keep it is not as good, unless it
should be roasted meats. Those contain higher fragrant properties;
so by putting the remains of roast meats in the stock-pot you
obtain a better flavor.</p>
<p>The shin bone is generally used, but the neck or
"sticking-piece," as the butchers call it, contains more of the
substance that you want to extract, makes a stronger and more
nutritious soup, than any other part of the animal. Meats for soup
should always be put on to cook in <i>cold</i> water, in a covered
pot, and allowed to simmer slowly for several <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span><a name='Page_28' id="Page_28"></a>hours,
in order that the essence of the meat may be drawn out thoroughly,
and should be carefully skimmed to prevent it from becoming turbid,
never allowed to <i>boil fast</i> at any time, and if more water is
needed, use boiling water from the tea-kettle; cold or lukewarm
water spoils the flavor. Never salt it before the meat is tender
(as that hardens and toughens the meat), especially if the meat is
to be eaten. Take off every particle of scum as it rises, and
before the vegetables are put in.</p>
<p>Allow a little less than a quart of water to a pound of meat and
bone, and a teaspoonful of salt. When done, strain through a
colander. If for clear soups, strain again through a hair sieve, or
fold a clean towel in a colander set over an earthen bowl, or any
dish large enough to hold the stock. As stated before, stock is not
as good when made entirely from cooked meats, but in a family where
it requires a large joint roasted every day, the bones, and bits
and underdone pieces of beef, or the bony structure of turkey or
chicken that has been left from carving, bones of roasted poultry,
these all assist in imparting a rich dark color to soup, and would
be sufficient, if stewed as above, to furnish a family, without
buying fresh meat for the purpose; still, with the addition of a
little fresh meat it would be more nutritious. In cold weather you
can gather them up for several days and put them to cook in cold
water, and when done, strain, and put aside until needed.</p>
<p>Soup will be as good the second day as the first if heated to
the boiling point. It should never be left in the pot, but should
be turned into a dish or shallow pan, and set aside to get cold.
Never cover it up, as that will cause it to turn sour very
quickly.</p>
<p>Before heating a second time, remove all the fat from the top.
If this be melted in, the flavor of the soup will certainly be
spoiled.</p>
<p>Thickened soups require nearly double the seasoning used for
thin soups or broth.</p>
<p>Coloring is used in some brown soups, the chief of which is
brown burnt sugar, which is known as caramel by French cooks.</p>
<p>Pounded spinach leaves give a fine green color to soup. Parsley,
or the green leaves of celery put in soup, will serve instead of
spinach.</p>
<p>Pound a large handful of spinach in a mortar, then tie it in a
cloth, and wring out all the juice; put this in the soup you wish
to color green five minutes before taking it up.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span><a name='Page_29' id=
"Page_29"></a>
<p>Mock turtle, and sometimes veal and lamb soups, should be this
color.</p>
<p>Okras gives a green color to soup.</p>
<p>To color soup red, skin six red tomatoes, squeeze out the seeds,
and put them into the soup with the other vegetables&mdash;or take
the juice only, as directed for spinach.</p>
<p>For white soups, which are of veal, lamb or chicken, none but
white vegetables are used; rice, pearl barley, vermicelli, or
macaroni, for thickening.</p>
<p>Grated carrot gives a fine amber color to soup; it must be put
in as soon as the soup is free from scum.</p>
<p>Hotel and private-house stock is quite different.</p>
<p>Hotels use meat in such large quantities that there is always
more or less trimmings and bones of meat to add to fresh meats;
that makes very strong stock, which they use in most all soups and
gravies and other made dishes.</p>
<p>The meat from which soup has been made is good to serve cold
thus: Take out all the bones, season with pepper and salt, and
catsup, if liked, then chop it small, tie it in a cloth, and lay it
between two plates, with a weight on the upper one; slice it thin
for luncheon or supper; or make sandwiches of it; or make a hash
for breakfast; or make it into balls, with the addition of a little
wheat flour and an egg, and serve them fried in fat, or boil in the
soup.</p>
<p>An agreeable flavor is sometimes imparted to soup by sticking
some cloves into the meat used for making stock; a few slices of
onions fried very brown in butter are nice; also flour browned by
simply putting it into a saucepan over the fire and stirring it
constantly until it is a dark brown.</p>
<p>Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened soups
about the consistency of cream. When soups and gravies are kept
from day to day in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day,
and put into fresh-scalded pans or tureens, and placed in a cool
cellar. In temperate weather, every other day may be
sufficient.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HERBS AND VEGETABLES USED IN SOUPS.</b></p>
<p>Of vegetables the principal ones are carrots, tomatoes,
asparagus, green peas, okra, macaroni, green corn, beans, rice,
vermicelli, Scotch barley, pearl barley, wheat flour, mushroom, or
mushroom catsup, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span><a name=
'Page_30' id="Page_30"></a>parsnips, beetroot, turnips, leeks,
garlic, shallots and onions; sliced onions fried with butter and
flour until they are browned, then rubbed through a sieve, are
excellent to heighten the color and flavor of brown sauces and
soups. The herbs usually used in soups are parsley, common thyme,
summer savory, knotted marjoram, and other seasonings, such as
bay-leaves, tarragon, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, mace,
black and white pepper, red pepper, lemon peel and juice, orange
peel and juice. The latter imparts a finer flavor and the acid much
milder. These materials, with wine, and the various catsups,
combined in various proportions, are, with other ingredients, made
into almost an endless variety of excellent soups and gravies.
Soups that are intended for the principal part of a meal certainly
ought not to be flavored like sauces, which are only intended to
give relish to some particular dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STOCK.</b></p>
<p>Six pounds of shin of beef, or six pounds of knuckle of veal;
any bones, trimmings of poultry, or fresh meat; one-quarter pound
of lean bacon or ham, two ounces of butter, two large onions, each
stuck with cloves; one turnip, three carrots, one head of celery,
two ounces of salt, one-half teaspoonful of whole pepper, one large
blade of mace, one bunch of savory herbs except sage, four quarts
and one-half-pint of cold water.</p>
<p>Cut up the meat and bacon, or ham, into pieces of about three
inches square; break the bones into small pieces, rub the butter on
the bottom of the stewpan; put in one-half a pint of water, the
broken bones, then meat and all other ingredients. Cover the
stewpan, and place it on a sharp fire, occasionally stirring its
contents. When the bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale,
jelly-like substance, add the four quarts of cold water, and simmer
very gently for five or six hours. As we have said before, do not
let it boil quickly. When nearly cooked, throw in a tablespoonful
of salt to assist the scum to rise. Remove every particle of scum
whilst it is doing, and strain it through a fine hair sieve; when
cool remove all grease. This stock will keep for many days in cold
weather.</p>
<p>Stock is the basis of many of the soups afterwards mentioned,
and this will be found quite strong enough for ordinary purposes.
Keep it in small jars, in a cool place. It makes a good gravy for
hash meats; one tablespoonful of it is sufficient to impart a fine
flavor to a dish of macaroni and various other dishes. Good soups
of various kinds are made from it at short notice; slice off a
portion of the jelly, add water, and whatever vegetables and
thickening preferred. It is best to partly cook the vegetables
before adding to the stock, as much boiling injures the flavoring
of the soup. Season and boil a few moments and serve hot.</p>

<p><b>WHITE STOCK.</b></p>
<p>White stock is used in the preparation of white soups, and is
made by boiling six pounds of a knuckle of veal, cut up in small
pieces, poultry trimmings, and four slices of lean ham. Proceed
according to directions given in STOCK, on opposite page.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLARIFY STOCK.</b></p>
<p>Place the stock in a clean saucepan, set it over a brisk fire.
When boiling, add the white of one egg to each quart of stock,
proceeding as follows: beat the whites of the eggs up well in a
little water; then add a little hot stock; beat to a froth and pour
gradually into the pot; then beat the whole hard and long; allow it
to boil up once, and immediately remove and strain through a thin
flannel cloth.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Select a small shin of beef of moderate size, crack the bone in
small pieces, wash and place it in a kettle to boil, with five or
six quarts of <i>cold</i> water. Let it boil about two hours, or
until it begins to get tender, then season it with a tablespoonful
of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper; boil it one hour longer, then
add to it one carrot, two turnips, two tablespoonfuls of rice or
pearl barley, one head of celery, and a teaspoonful of summer
savory powdered fine; the vegetables to be minced up in small
pieces like dice. After these ingredients have boiled a quarter of
an hour, put in two potatoes cut up in small pieces, let it boil
half an hour longer; take the meat from the soup, and if intended
to be served with it, take out the bones and lay it closely and
neatly on a dish, and garnish with sprigs of parsley.</p>
<p>Serve made mustard and catsup with it. It is very nice pressed
and eaten cold with mustard and vinegar, or catsup. Four hours are
required for making this soup. Should any remain over the first
day, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span><a name='Page_32' id=
"Page_32"></a>it may be heated, with the addition of a little
boiling water, and served again. Some fancy a glass of brown sherry
added just before being served. Serve very hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL SOUP. (Excellent.)</b></p>
<p>Put a knuckle of veal into three quarts of cold water, with a
small quantity of salt, and one small tablespoonful of uncooked
rice. Boil slowly, hardly above simmering, four hours, when the
liquor should be reduced to half the usual quantity; remove from
the fire. Into the tureen put the yolk of one egg, and stir well
into it a teacupful of cream, or, in hot weather, new milk; add a
piece of butter the size of a hickory nut; on this strain the soup,
boiling hot, stirring all the time. Just at the last, beat it well
for a minute.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCOTCH MUTTON BROTH.</b></p>
<p>Six pounds neck of mutton, three quarts water, five carrots,
five turnips, two onions, four tablespoonfuls barley, a little
salt. Soak mutton in water for an hour, cut off scrag, and put it
in stewpan with three quarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim
well, and then simmer for one and one-half hours. Cut best end of
mutton into cutlets, dividing it with two bones in each; take off
nearly all fat before you put it into broth; skim the moment the
meat boils, and every ten minutes afterwards; add carrots, turnips
and onions, all cut into two or three pieces, then put them into
soup soon enough to be thoroughly done; stir in barley; add salt to
taste; let all stew together for three and one-half hours; about
one-half hour before sending it to table, put in little chopped
parsley and serve.</p>
<p>Cut the meat off the scrag into small pieces, and send it to
table in the tureen with the soup. The other half of the mutton
should be served on a separate dish, with whole turnips boiled and
laid round it. Many persons are fond of mutton that has been boiled
in soup.</p>
<p>You may thicken the soup with rice or barley that has first been
soaked in cold water, or with green peas, or with young corn, cut
down from the cob, or with tomatoes, scalded, peeled and cut into
pieces.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GAME SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Two grouse or partridges, or, if you have neither, use a pair of
rabbits; half a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span><a name=
'Page_33' id="Page_33"></a>pound of lean ham; two medium-sized
onions; one pound of lean beef; fried bread; butter for frying;
pepper, salt and two stalks of white celery cut into inch lengths;
three quarts of water.</p>
<p>Joint your game neatly; cut the ham and onions into small
pieces, fry all in butter to a light brown. Put into a soup-pot
with the beef, cut into strips, add a little pepper. Pour on the
water; heat slowly, and stew gently two hours. Take out the pieces
of bird, and cover in a bowl; cook the soup an hour longer; strain;
cool; drop in the celery and simmer ten minutes. Pour upon fried
bread in the tureen.</p>
<p>Venison soup made the same, with the addition of a tablespoonful
of brown flour wet into a paste with cold water, adding a
tablespoonful of catsup, Worcestershire, or other pungent sauce,
and a glass of Madeira or brown sherry.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CONSOMM&Eacute; SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Take good strong stock (see pages 27 and 30), remove all fat
from the surface, and for each quart of the stock allow the white
and shell of one egg and a tablespoonful of water, well whipped
together. Pour this mixture into a saucepan containing the stock;
place it over the fire and heat the contents gradually, stirring
often to prevent the egg from sticking to the bottom of the
saucepan. Allow it to boil gently until the stock looks perfectly
clear under the egg, which will rise and float upon the surface in
the form of a thick white scum. Now remove it and pour it into a
folded towel laid in a colander set over an earthen bowl, allowing
it to run through without moving or squeezing it. Season with more
salt if needed, and quickly serve very hot. This should be a clear
amber color.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JULIENNE SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Cut carrots and turnips into quarter-inch pieces the shape of
dice; also celery into thin slices. Cover them with boiling water;
add a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful pepper, and cook
until soft. In another saucepan have two quarts of boiling stock
(see pages 27 and 30), to which add the cooked vegetables, the
water and more seasoning if necessary. Serve hot.</p>
<p>In the spring and summer season use asparagus, peas and string
beans&mdash;all cut into small uniform thickness.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span><a name='Page_34' id=
"Page_34"></a>
<p><b>CREAM OF SPINACH.</b></p>
<p>Pick, wash and boil enough spinach to measure a pint, when
cooked, chopped and pounded into a soft paste. Put it into a
stewpan with four ounces of fresh butter, a little grated nutmeg, a
teaspoonful of salt. Cook and stir it about ten minutes. Add to
this two quarts of strong stock (see pages 27 and 30); let boil up,
then rub it through a strainer. Set it over the fire again, and,
when on the point of boiling, mix with it a tablespoonful of
butter, and a teaspoonful of granulated sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN CREAM SOUP.</b></p>
<p>An old chicken for soup is much the best. Cut it up into
quarters, put it into a soup kettle with half a pound of corned
ham, and an onion; add four quarts of cold water. Bring slowly to a
gentle boil, and keep this up until the liquid has diminished
one-third, and the meat drops from the bones; then add half a cup
of rice. Season with salt, pepper and a bunch of chopped
parsley.</p>
<p>Cook slowly until the rice is tender, then the meat should be
taken out. Now stir in two cups of rich milk thickened with a
little flour. The chicken could be fried in a spoonful of butter
and a gravy made, reserving some of the white part of the meat,
chopping it and adding it to the soup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN ECONOMICAL SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Take a cold roast-beef bone, pieces of beefsteak, the rack of a
cold turkey or chicken. Put them into a pot with three or four
quarts of water, two carrots, three turnips, one onion, a few
cloves, pepper and salt. Boil the whole gently four hours; then
strain it through a colander, mashing the vegetables so that they
will all pass through. Skim off the fat, and return the soup to the
pot. Mix one tablespoonful of flour with two of water, stir it into
the soup and boil the whole ten minutes. Serve this soup with
sippits of toast.</p>
<p>Sippits are bits of dry toast cut into a triangular form.</p>

<br>
<p><b>OX-TAIL SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Two ox-tails, two slices of ham, one ounce of butter, two
carrots, two turnips, three onions, one leek, one head of celery,
one bunch of savory herbs, pepper, a tablespoonful of salt, two
tablespoonfuls of catsup, one-half glass of port wine, three quarts
of water.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span><a name='Page_35' id=
"Page_35"></a>
<p>Cut up the tails, separating them at the joints; wash them, and
put them in a stewpan with the butter. Cut the vegetables in slices
and add them with the herbs. Put in one-half pint of water, and
stir it over a quick fire till the juices are drawn. Fill up the
stewpan with water, and, when boiling, add the salt. Skim well, and
simmer very gently for four hours, or until the tails are tender.
Take them out, skim and strain the soup, thicken with flour, and
flavor with the catsup and port wine. Put back the tails, simmer
for five minutes and serve.</p>
<p>Another way to make an appetizing ox-tail soup. You should begin
to make it the day before you wish to eat the soup. Take two tails,
wash clean, and put in a kettle with nearly a gallon of cold water;
add a small handful of salt; when the meat is well cooked, take out
the bones. Let this stand in a cool room, covered, and next day,
about an hour and a half before dinner, skim off the crust or cake
of fat which has risen to the top. Add a little onion, carrot, or
any vegetables you choose, chopping them fine first; summer savory
may also be added.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CORN SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Cut the corn from the cob, and boil the cobs in water for at
least an hour, then add the grains, and boil until they are
thoroughly done; put one dozen ears of corn to a gallon of water,
which will be reduced to three quarts by the time the soup is done;
then pour on a pint of new milk, two well-beaten eggs, salt and
pepper to your taste; continue the boiling a while longer, and stir
in, to season and thicken it a little, a tablespoonful of good
butter rubbed up with two tablespoonfuls of flour. Corn soup may
also be made nicely with water in which a pair of grown fowls have
been boiled or parboiled, instead of having plain water for the
foundation.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPLIT PEA SOUP. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Wash well a pint of split peas and cover them well with cold
water, adding a third of a teaspoonful of soda; let them remain in
it over night to swell. In the morning put them in a kettle with a
close fitting cover. Pour over them three quarts of cold water,
adding half a pound of lean ham or bacon cut into slices or pieces;
also a teaspoonful of salt and a little pepper, and some celery
chopped fine. When the soup begins to boil, skim the froth from the
surface. Cook slowly from three to four hours, stirring
occasionally till the peas are <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
36]</span><a name='Page_36' id="Page_36"></a>all dissolved, adding
a little more boiling water to keep up the quantity as it boils
away. Strain through a colander, and leave out the meat. It should
be quite quick. Serve with small squares of toasted bread, cut up
and added. If not rich enough, add a small piece of butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM OF ASPARAGUS.</b></p>
<p>For making two quarts of soup, use two bundles of fresh
asparagus. Cut the tops from one of the bunches and cook them
twenty minutes in salted water, enough to cover them. Cook the
remainder of the asparagus about twenty minutes in a quart of stock
or water. Cut an onion into thin slices and fry in three
tablespoonfuls of butter ten minutes, being careful not to scorch
it; then add the asparagus that has been boiled in the stock; cook
this five minutes, stirring constantly; then add three
tablespoonfuls of dissolved flour, cook five minutes longer. Turn
this mixture into the boiling stock and boil twenty minutes. Rub
through a sieve; add the milk and cream and the asparagus heads. If
water is used in place of stock, use all cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN PEA SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Wash a small quarter of lamb in cold water, and put it into a
soup-pot with six quarts of cold water; add to it two
tablespoonfuls of salt, and set it over a moderate fire&mdash;let
it boil gently for two hours, then skim it clear; add a quart of
shelled peas, and a teaspoonful of pepper; cover it, and let it
boil for half an hour; then having scraped the skins from a quart
of small young potatoes, add them to the soup; cover the pot and
let it boil for half an hour longer; work quarter of a pound of
butter and a dessertspoonful of flour together, and add them to the
soup ten or twelve minutes before taking it off the fire.</p>
<p>Serve the meat on a dish with parsley sauce over it, and the
soup in a tureen.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRIED BEAN SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Put two quarts of dried white beans to soak the night before you
make the soup, which should be put on as early in the day as
possible.</p>
<p>Take two pounds of the lean of fresh beef&mdash;the coarse
pieces will do. Cut them up and put them into your soup-pot with
the bones belonging to them (which should be broken in pieces), and
a pound of lean bacon, cut very small. If you have the remains of a
piece of beef <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span><a name='Page_37'
id="Page_37"></a>that has been roasted the day before, and so much
underdone that the juices remain in it, you may put it into the pot
and its bones along with it. Season the meat with pepper only, and
pour on it six quarts of water. As soon as it boils, take off the
scum, and put in the beans (having first drained them) and a head
of celery cut small, or a tablespoonful of pounded celery seed.
Boil it slowly till the meat is done to shreds, and the beans all
dissolved. Then strain it through a colander into the tureen, and
put into it small squares of toasted bread with the crust cut
off.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TURTLE SOUP FROM BEANS.</b></p>
<p>Soak over night one quart of black beans; next day boil them in
the proper quantity of water, say a gallon, then dip the beans out
of the pot and strain them through a colander. Then return the
flour of the beans, thus pressed, into the pot in which they were
boiled. Tie up in a thin cloth some thyme, a teaspoonful of summer
savory and parsley, and let it boil in the mixture. Add a
tablespoonful of cold butter, salt and pepper. Have ready four
hard-boiled yolks of eggs quartered, and a few force meat balls;
add this to the soup with a sliced lemon, and half a glass of wine
just before serving the soup.</p>
<p>This approaches so near in flavor to the real turtle soup that
few are able to distinguish the difference.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PHILADELPHIA PEPPER POT.</b></p>
<p>Put two pounds of tripe and four calves' feet into the soup-pot
and cover them with cold water; add a red pepper, and boil closely
until the calves' feet are boiled very tender; take out the meat,
skim the liquid, stir it, cut the tripe into small pieces, and put
it back into the liquid; if there is not enough liquid, add boiling
water; add half a teaspoonful of sweet marjoram, sweet basil, and
thyme, two sliced onions, sliced potatoes, salt. When the
vegetables have boiled until almost tender, add a piece of butter
rolled in flour, drop in some egg balls, and boil fifteen minutes
more. Take up and serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SQUIRREL SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Wash and quarter three or four good sized squirrels; put them
on, with a small tablespoonful of salt, directly after breakfast,
in a gallon of cold water. Cover the pot close, and set it on the
back part <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span><a name='Page_38' id=
"Page_38"></a>of the stove to simmer gently, <i>not</i> boil. Add
vegetables just the same as you do in case of other meat soups in
the summer season, but especially good will you find corn, Irish
potatoes, tomatoes and Lima beans. Strain the soup through a coarse
colander when the meat has boiled to shreds, so as to get rid of
the squirrels' troublesome little bones. Then return to the pot,
and after boiling a while longer, thicken with a piece of butter
rubbed in flour. Celery and parsley leaves chopped up are also
considered an improvement by many. Toast two slices of bread, cut
them into dice one-half inch square, fry them in butter, put them
into the bottom of your tureen, and then pour the soup boiling hot
upon them. Very good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO SOUP. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Place in a kettle four pounds of beef. Pour over it one gallon
of cold water. Let the meat and water boil slowly for three hours,
or until the liquid is reduced to about one-half. Remove the meat
and put into the broth a quart of tomatoes, and one chopped onion;
salt and pepper to taste. A teaspoonful of flour should be
dissolved and stirred in, then allowed to boil half an hour longer.
Strain and serve hot. Canned tomatoes in place of fresh ones may be
used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO SOUP. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Place over the fire a quart of peeled tomatoes, stew them soft
with a pinch of soda. Strain it so that no seeds remain, set it
over the fire again, and add a quart of hot boiled milk; season
with salt and pepper, a piece of butter the size of an egg, add
three tablespoonfuls of rolled cracker, and serve hot. Canned
tomatoes may be used in place of fresh ones.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO SOUP. No. 3.</b></p>
<p>Peel two quarts of tomatoes, boil them in a saucepan with an
onion, and other soup vegetables; strain and add a level
tablespoonful of flour dissolved in a third of a cup of melted
butter; add pepper and salt. Serve very hot over little squares of
bread fried brown and crisp in butter.</p>
<p>An excellent addition to a cold meat lunch.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MULLAGATAWNY SOUP. (As made in India.)</b></p>
<p>Cut four onions, one carrot, two turnips, and one head of celery
into three quarts of liquor, in which one or two fowls have been
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span><a name='Page_39' id=
"Page_39"></a>boiled; keep it over a brisk fire till it boils, then
place it on a corner of the fire, and let it simmer twenty minutes;
add one tablespoonful of currie powder, and one tablespoonful of
flour; mix the whole well together, and let it boil three minutes;
pass it through a colander; serve with pieces of roast chicken in
it; add boiled rice in a separate dish. It must be of good yellow
color, and not too thick. If you find it too thick, add a little
boiling water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Half veal and half
chicken answers as well.</p>
<p>A dish of rice, to be served separately with this soup, must be
thus prepared: put three pints of water in a saucepan and one
tablespoonful of salt; let this boil. Wash well, in three waters,
half a pound of rice; strain it, and put it into the boiling water
in saucepan. After it has come to the boil&mdash;which it will do
in about two minutes&mdash;let it boil twenty minutes; strain it
through a colander, and pour over it two quarts of cold water. This
will separate the grains of rice. Put it back in the saucepan, and
place it near the fire until hot enough to send to the table. This
is also the proper way to boil rice for curries. If these
directions are strictly carried out every grain of the rice will
separate, and be thoroughly cooked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOCK TURTLE SOUP, OF CALF'S HEAD.</b></p>
<p>Scald a well-cleansed calf's head, remove the brain, tie it up
in a cloth, and boil an hour, or until the meat will easily slip
from the bone; take out, save the broth; cut it in small square
pieces, and throw them into cold water; when cool, put it in a
stewpan, and cover with some of the broth; let it boil until quite
tender, and set aside.</p>
<p>In another stewpan melt some butter, and in it put a quarter of
a pound of lean ham, cut small, with fine herbs to taste; also
parsley and one onion; add about a pint of the broth; let it simmer
for two hours, and then dredge in a small quantity of flour; now
add the remainder of the broth, and a quarter bottle of Madeira or
sherry; let all stew quietly for ten minutes and rub it through a
medium sieve; add the calf's head, season with a very little
cayenne pepper, a little salt, the juice of one lemon, and, if
desired, a quarter teaspoonful pounded mace and a dessert-spoon
sugar.</p>

<p><b>GREEN TURTLE SOUP.</b></p>
<p>One turtle, two onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, juice of one
lemon, five quarts of water, a glass of Madeira.</p>
<p>After removing the entrails, cut up the coarser parts of the
turtle meat and bones. Add four quarts of water, and stew four
hours with the herbs, onions, pepper and salt. Stew very slowly, do
not let it cease boiling during this time. At the end of four hours
strain the soup, and add the finer parts of the turtle and the
green fat, which has been simmered one hour in two quarts of water.
Thicken with brown flour; return to the soup-pot, and simmer gently
for an hour longer. If there are eggs in the turtle, boil them in a
separate vessel for four hours, and throw into the soup before
taking up. If not, put in force meat balls; then the juice of the
lemon, and the wine; beat up at once and pour out.</p>
<p>Some cooks add the finer meat before straining, boiling all
together five hours; then strain, thicken and put in the green fat,
cut into lumps an inch long. This makes a handsomer soup than if
the meat is left in.</p>
<p>Green turtle can now be purchased preserved in air-tight
cans.</p>
<p><i>Force Meat Balls for the Above.</i>&mdash;Six tablespoonfuls
of turtle meat chopped very fine. Rub to a paste, with the yolk of
two hard-boiled eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, and, if
convenient, a little oyster liquor. Season with cayenne, mace, half
a teaspoonful of white sugar and a pinch of salt. Bind all with a
well-beaten egg; shape into small balls; dip in egg, then powdered
cracker; fry in butter, and drop into the soup when it is
served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MACARONI SOUP.</b></p>
<p>To a rich beef or other soup, in which there is no seasoning
other than pepper or salt, take half a pound of small pipe
macaroni, boil it in clear water until it is tender, then drain it
and cut it in pieces of an inch length; boil it for fifteen minutes
in the soup and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TURKEY SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Take the turkey bones and boil three-quarters of an hour in
water enough to cover them; add a little summer savory and celery
chopped fine. Just before serving, thicken with a little flour
(browned), and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span><a name=
'Page_41' id="Page_41"></a>season with pepper, salt and a small
piece of butter. This is a cheap but good soup, using the remains
of cold turkey which might otherwise be thrown away.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GUMBO OR OKRA SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Fry out the fat of a slice of bacon or fat ham, drain it off,
and in it fry the slices of a large onion brown; scald, peel and
cut up two quarts fresh tomatoes, when in season (use canned
tomatoes otherwise), and cut thin one quart okra; put them,
together with a little chopped parsley, in a stew-kettle with about
three quarts of hot broth of any kind; cook slowly for three hours,
season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.</p>
<p>In chicken broth the same quantity of okra pods, used for
thickening instead of tomatoes, forms a chicken gumbo soup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TAPIOCA CREAM SOUP.</b></p>
<p>One quart of white stock; one pint of cream or milk; one onion;
two stalks celery; one-third of a cupful of tapioca; two cupfuls of
cold water; one tablespoonful of butter; a small piece of mace;
salt, pepper. Wash the tapioca and soak over night in cold water.
Cook it and the stock together very gently for one hour. Cut the
onion and celery into small pieces, and put on to cook for twenty
minutes with the milk and mace. Strain on the tapioca and stock.
Season with salt and pepper, add butter and serve.</p>

<p><b>CELERY SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Celery soup may be made with <i>white stock</i>. Cut down the
white of half a dozen heads of celery into little pieces and boil
it in four pints of white stock, with a quarter of a pound of lean
ham and two ounces of butter. Simmer gently for a full hour, then
strain through a sieve, return the liquor to the pan, and stir in a
few spoonfuls of cream with great care. Serve with toasted bread,
and if liked, thicken with a little flour. Season to taste.</p>
<br>
<p><b>IRISH POTATO SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Peel and boil eight medium-sized potatoes with a large onion
sliced, some herbs, salt and pepper; press all through a colander;
then thin it with rich milk and add a lump of butter, more
seasoning, if necessary; let it heat well and serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEA SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Put a quart of dried peas into five quarts of water; boil for
four hours; then add three or four large onions, two heads of
celery, a carrot, two turnips, all cut up rather fine. Season with
pepper and salt. Boil two hours longer, and if the soup becomes too
thick add more water. Strain through a colander and stir in a
tablespoonful of cold butter. Serve hot, with small pieces of
toasted bread placed in the bottom of the tureen.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NOODLES FOR SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Beat up one egg light, add a pinch of salt, and flour enough to
make a <i>very stiff</i> dough; roll out very thin, like thin pie
crust, dredge with flour to keep from sticking. Let it remain on
the bread board to dry for an hour or more; then roll it up into a
tight scroll, like a sheet of music. Begin at the end and slice it
into slips as thin as straws. After all are cut, mix them lightly
together, and to prevent them sticking, keep them floured a little
until you are ready to drop them into your soup which should be
done shortly before dinner, for if boiled <i>too long</i> they will
go to pieces.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FORCE MEAT BALLS FOR SOUP.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of cooked veal or fowl meat, minced; mix with this a
handful of fine bread crumbs, the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]</span><a name='Page_44' id=

season with pepper and salt; add a half teaspoon of flour, and bind
all together with two beaten eggs; the hands to be well floured,
and the mixture to be made into little balls the size of a nutmeg;
drop into the soup about twenty minutes before serving.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGG BALLS FOR SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Take the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs and half a tablespoonful
of wheat flour, rub them smooth with the yolks of two raw eggs and
a teaspoonful of salt; mix all well together; make it in balls, and
drop them into the boiling soup a few minutes before taking it
up.</p>
<p>Used in green turtle soup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGG DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP.</b></p>
<p>To half a pint of milk put two well-beaten eggs, and as much
wheat flour as will make a smooth, rather <i>thick</i> batter free
from lumps; drop this batter, a tablespoonful at a time, into
boiling soup.</p>
<p><i>Another Mode.</i>&mdash;One cupful of sour cream and one
cupful of sour milk, three eggs, well beaten, whites and yolks
separately; one teaspoonful of salt, one level teaspoonful of soda,
dissolved in a spoonful of water, and enough flour added to make a
<i>very stiff</i> batter. To be dropped by spoonfuls into the broth
and boiled twenty minutes, or until no raw dough shows on the
outside.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUET DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Three cups of sifted flour in which three teaspoonfuls of baking
powder have been sifted; one cup of finely chopped suet, well
rubbed into the flour, with a teaspoonful of salt. Wet all with
sweet milk to make a dough as stiff as biscuit. Make into small
balls as large as peaches, well floured. Drop into the soup
three-quarters of an hour before being served. This requires steady
boiling, being closely covered, and the cover not to be removed
until taken up to serve. A very good form of pot-pie.</p>

remains; put it in a mortar, pound it ten minutes or until in a
pur&eacute;e; pass it through <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
45]</span><a name='Page_45' id="Page_45"></a>a wire sieve (use the
remainder in stock), then take 1 lb. of good fresh beef suet, which
skin, shred and chop very fine; put it in a mortar and pound it,
then add 6 oz. of panada (that is, bread soaked in milk, and boiled
till nearly dry) with the suet; pound them well together, and add
the veal, season with 1 teaspoonful of salt, &frac14; teaspoonful
of pepper, &frac12; that of nutmeg; work all well together; then
add four eggs by degrees, continually pounding the contents of the
mortar. When well mixed, take a small piece in a spoon, and poach
it in some boiling water, and if it is delicate, firm, and of a
good flavor, it is ready for use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROUTONS FOR SOUP.</b></p>
<p>In a frying pan have the depth of an inch of boiling fat; also
have prepared slices of stale bread cut up into little half-inch
squares; drop into the frying pan enough of these bits of bread to
cover the surface of the fat. When browned, remove with a skimmer
and drain; add to the hot soup and serve.</p>
<p>Some prefer them prepared in this manner:</p>
<p>Take very thin slices of bread, butter them well; cut them up
into little squares three-fourths of an inch thick, place them in a
baking pan, buttered side up, and brown in a quick oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH STOCK.</b></p>
<p>Place a saucepan over the fire with a good-sized piece of sweet
butter and a sliced onion; put into that some sliced tomatoes, then
add as many different kinds of fish as you can get&mdash;oysters,
clams, smelts, pawns, crabs, shrimps and all kinds of pan-fish;
cook all together until the onions are well browned; then add a
bunch of sweet herbs, salt and pepper, and sufficient water to make
the required amount of stock. After this has cooked for half an
hour pound it with a wooden pestle, then strain and cook again
until it jellies.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH SOUP.</b></p>
<p>Select a large, fine fish, clean it thoroughly, put it over the

sweet herbs. When the fish is cooked, and is quite tasteless,
strain all through a colander, return to the fire, add some butter,
salt and pepper to taste. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg

<p>Having boiled one fine middle-sized lobster, extract all the
meat from the body and claws. Bruise part of the coral in a mortar,
and also an equal quantity of the meat. Mix them well together. Add
mace, cayenne, salt and pepper, and make them up into force meat
balls, binding the mixture with the yolk of an egg slightly
beaten.</p>
<p>Take three quarts of the veal broth and put it into the meat of
the lobster cut into mouthfuls. Boil it together about twenty
minutes. Then thicken it with the remaining coral (which you must
first rub through a sieve), and add the force meat balls and a
little butter rolled in flour. Simmer it gently for ten minutes,
but do not let it come to a boil, as that will injure the color.
Serve with small dice of bread fried brown in butter.</p>

<a name='MODES_OF_FRYING' id="MODES_OF_FRYING"></a>
<h2><b>MODES OF FRYING</b></h2>
<br>
<p>The usual custom among professional cooks is to entirely immerse
the article to be cooked in boiling fat, but from inconvenience
most households use the half-frying method of frying in a small
amount of fat in a frying pan. For the first method a shallow iron
frying kettle, large at the top and small at the bottom, is best to
use. The fat should half fill the kettle, or an amount sufficient
to float whatever is to be fried; the heat of the fat should get to
such a degree that, when a piece of bread or a teaspoonful of the
batter is dropped in it, it will become brown almost instantly, but
should not be so hot as to burn the fat. Some cooks say that the
fat should be smoking, but my experience is, that is a mistake, as
that soon ruins the fat. As soon as it begins to smoke it should be
removed a little to one side, and still be kept at the boiling
point. If fritters, crullers, croquettes, etc., are dropped into
fat that is too hot, it crusts over the outside before the inside
has fully risen, making a heavy, hard article, and also ruining the
fat, giving it a burnt flavor.</p>
<p>Many French cooks prefer beef fat or suet to lard for frying
purposes, considering it more wholesome and digestible, does not
impart as much flavor, or adhere or soak into the article cooked as
pork fat.</p>
<p>In families of any size, where there is much cooking required,
there are enough drippings and fat remnants from roasts of beef,
skimmings from the soup kettle, with the addition of occasionally a
pound of suet from the market, to amply supply the need. All such
remnants and skimmings should be clarified about twice a week, by
boiling them all together in water. When the fat is all melted, it
should be strained with the water and set aside to cool. After the
fat on the top has hardened, lift the cake from the water on which
it lies, scrape off all the dark particles from the bottom, then
melt over <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]</span><a name='Page_49' id=
"Page_49"></a>again the fat; while hot strain into a small clean
stone jar or bright tin pail, and then it is ready for use. Always
after frying anything, the fat should stand until it settles and
has cooled somewhat; then turn off carefully so as to leave it
clear from the sediment that settles at the bottom.</p>
<p>Refined cotton-seed oil is now being adopted by most
professional cooks in hotels, restaurants and many private
households for culinary purposes, and will doubtless in future
supersede animal fats, especially for frying, it being quite as
delicate a medium as frying with olive oil. It is now sold by
leading grocers, put up in packages of two and four quarts.</p>
<p>The second mode of frying, using a frying pan with a small
quantity of fat or grease, to be done properly, should, in the
first place, have the frying pan hot over the fire, and the fat in
it <i>actually boiling</i> before the article to be cooked is
placed in it, the intense heat quickly searing up the pores of the
article and forming a brown crust on the lower side, then turning
over and browning the other the same way.</p>
<p>Still, there is another mode of frying; the process is somewhat
similar to broiling, the hot frying pan or spider replacing the hot
fire. To do this correctly, a thick bottomed frying pan should be
used. Place it over the fire, and when it is so hot that it will
siss, oil over the bottom of the pan with a piece of suet, that is
if the meat is all lean; if not, it is not necessary to grease the
bottom of the pan. Lay in the meat quite flat, and brown it
quickly, first on one side, then on the other; when sufficiently
cooked, dish on a <i>hot</i> platter and season the same as broiled
meats.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH.</b></p>
<p>In selecting fish, choose those only in which the eye is full
and prominent, the flesh thick and firm, the scales bright and fins
stiff. They should be thoroughly cleaned before cooking.</p>
<p>The usual modes of cooking fish are boiled, baked, broiled,
fried and occasionally stewed. Steaming fish is much superior to
boiling, but the ordinary conveniences in private houses do not
admit of the possibility of enjoying this delicate way of cooking
it. Large fish are generally boiled, medium-sized ones baked or
boiled, the smaller <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]</span><a name=
'Page_50' id="Page_50"></a>kinds fried or broiled. Very large fish,
such as cod, halibut, etc., are cut in steaks or slices for frying
or broiling. The heads of some fish, as the cod, halibut, etc., are
considered tidbits by many. Small fish, or pan-fish, as they are
usually called, are served without the heads, with the exception of
brook-trout and smelts; these are usually cooked whole, with the
heads on. Bake fish slowly, basting often with butter and water.
Salmon is considered the most nutritious of all fish. When boiling
fish, by adding a little vinegar and salt to the water, it seasons
and prevents the nutriment from being drawn out; the vinegar acting
on the water hardens the water.</p>
<p>Fill the fish with a nicely prepared stuffing of rolled cracker
or stale bread crumbs, seasoned with butter, pepper, salt, sage and
any other aromatic herbs fancied; sew up; wrap in a well-floured
cloth, tied closely with twine, and boil or steam. The garnishes
for boiled fish are: for turbot, fried smelts; for other boiled
fish, parsley, sliced beets, lemon or sliced boiled egg. Do not use
the knives, spoons, etc., that are used in cooking fish, for other
food, as they will be apt to impart a fishy flavor.</p>
<p>Fish to be boiled should be put into <i>cold water</i> and set
on the fire to cook very gently, or the outside will break before
the inner part is done. Unless the fish are small, they should
never be put into warm water; nor should water, either hot or cold,
be poured <i>on</i> to the fish, as it is liable to break the skin;
if it should be necessary to add a little water while the fish is
cooking, it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the
vessel.</p>
<p>Fish to be broiled should lie, after they are dressed, for two
or three hours, with their inside well sprinkled with salt and
pepper.</p>
<p>Salt fish should be soaked in water before boiling, according to
the time it has been in salt. When it is hard and dry, it will
require thirty-six hours soaking before it is dressed, and the
water must be changed three or four times. When fish is not very
salt, twenty-four hours, or even one night, will suffice.</p>
<p>When frying fish the fire must be hot enough to bring the fat to
such a degree of heat as to sear the surface and make it impervious
to the fat, and at the same time seal up the rich juices. As soon
as the fish is browned by this sudden application of heat, the pan
may be moved to a cooler place on the stove, that the process may
be finished more slowly.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]</span><a name='Page_51' id=
"Page_51"></a>
<p>Fat in which fish has been fried is just as good to use again
for the same purpose, but it should be kept by itself and not put
to any other use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO FRY FISH.</b></p>
<p>Most of the smaller fish (generally termed pan-fish) are usually
fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out
the backbone, and slice the body crosswise into five or six pieces;
season with salt and pepper. Dip in Indian meal or wheat flour, or
in beaten egg, and roll in bread or fine cracker crumbs&mdash;trout
and perch should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick bottomed
iron frying pan, the flesh side down, with hot lard or drippings;
fry slowly, turning when lightly browned. The following method may
be deemed preferable: Dredge the pieces with flour; brush them over
with beaten egg; roll in bread crumbs, and fry in hot lard or
drippings sufficient to cover, the same as frying crullers. If the
fat is very hot, the fish will fry without absorbing it, and it
will be palatably cooked. When browned on one side, turn it over in
the fat and brown the other, draining when done. This is a
particularly good way to fry slices of large fish. Serve with
tomato sauce; garnish with slices of lemon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PAN-FISH.</b></p>
<p>Place them in a thick bottomed frying pan with heads all one
way. Fill the spaces with smaller fish. When they are fried quite
brown and ready to turn, put a dinner plate over them, drain off
the fat; then invert the pan, and they will be left unbroken on the
plate. Put the lard back into the pan, and when <i>hot</i> slip
back the fish. When the other side is brown, drain, turn on a plate
as before, and slip them on a warm platter, to be sent to the
table. Leaving the heads on and the fish a crispy-brown, in perfect
shape, improves the appearance if not the flavor. Garnish with
slices of lemon.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Hotel Lafayette, Philadelphia.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED PICKEREL.</b></p>
<p>Carefully clean and wipe the fish, and lay in a dripping pan
with enough hot water to prevent scorching. A perforated sheet of
tin, fitting loosely, or several muffin rings may be used to keep
it off the bottom. Lay it in a circle on its belly, head and tail
touching, and tied, or as directed in note on fish; bake slowly,
basting often with butter and water. When done, have ready a cup of
sweet cream or rich <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]</span><a name=
'Page_52' id="Page_52"></a>milk to which a few spoons of hot water
has been added; stir in two large spoons of melted butter and a
little chopped parsley; heat all by setting the cup in boiling
water; add the gravy from the dripping-pan, and let it boil up
once; place the fish in a hot dish and pour over it the sauce. Or
an egg sauce may be made with drawn butter; stir in the yolk of an
egg quickly, and then a teaspoon of chopped parsley. It can be
stuffed or not, just as you please.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED SALMON.</b></p>
<p>The middle slice of salmon is the best. Sew up neatly in a
mosquito-net bag, and boil a quarter of an hour to the pound in hot
salted water. When done, unwrap with care, and lay upon a hot dish,
taking care not to break it. Have ready a large cupful of drawn
butter, very rich, in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of
minced parsley and the juice of a lemon. Pour half upon the salmon
and serve the rest in a boat. Garnish with parsley and sliced
eggs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED SALMON.</b></p>
<p>Cut slices from an inch to an inch and an half thick, dry them
in a cloth, season with salt and pepper, dredge them in sifted
flour, and broil on a gridiron rubbed with suet.</p>
<p><i>Another Mode.</i>&mdash;Cut the slices one inch thick, and
season them with pepper and salt; butter a sheet of white paper,
lay each slice on a separate piece, envelop them in it with their
ends twisted; broil gently over a clear fire, and serve with
anchovy or caper sauce. When higher seasoning is required, add a
few chopped herbs and a little spice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRESH SALMON FRIED.</b></p>
<p>Cut the slices three-quarters of an inch thick, dredge them with
flour, or dip them in egg and crumbs; fry a light brown. This mode
answers for all fish cut into steaks. Season well with salt and
pepper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALMON AND CAPER SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Two slices of salmon, one-quarter pound butter, one-half
teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one shallot; salt and pepper to
taste.</p>
<p>Lay the salmon in a baking dish, place pieces of butter over it,
and add the other ingredients, rubbing a little of the seasoning
into the fish; place it in the oven and baste it frequently; when
done, take <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]</span><a name='Page_53'
id="Page_53"></a>it out and drain for a minute or two; lay it in a
dish, pour caper sauce over it and serve. Salmon dressed in this
way, with tomato sauce, is very delicious.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED SALT SALMON OR OTHER SALT FISH.</b></p>
<p>Soak salmon in tepid or cold water twenty-four hours, changing
water several times, or let stand under faucet of running water. If
in a hurry, or desiring a very salt relish, it may do to soak a
short time, having water warm, and changing, parboiling slightly.
At the hour wanted, broil sharply. Season to suit taste, covering
with butter. This recipe will answer for all kinds of salt
fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED SALMON.</b></p>
<p>Take a fine, fresh salmon, and, having cleaned it, cut it into
large pieces, and boil it in salted water as if for eating. Then
drain it, wrap it in a dry cloth, and set it in a cold place till
next day. Then make the pickle, which must be in proportion to the
quantity of fish. To one quart of the water in which the salmon was
boiled, allow two quarts of the best vinegar, one ounce of whole
black pepper, one nutmeg grated and a dozen blades of mace. Boil
all these together in a kettle closely covered to prevent the
flavor from evaporating. When the vinegar thus prepared is quite
cold, pour it over the salmon, and put on the top a tablespoonful
of sweet oil, which will make it keep the longer.</p>
<p>Cover it closely, put it in a dry, cool place, and it will be
good for many months. This is the nicest way of preserving salmon,
and is approved by all who have tried it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SMOKED SALMON.</b></p>
<p>Smoked salmon to be broiled should be put upon the gridiron
first, with the flesh side to the fire.</p>
<p>Smoked salmon is very nice when shaved like smoked beef, and
served with coffee or tea.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRICASSEE SALMON.</b></p>
<p>This way of cooking fresh salmon is a pleasant change from the
ordinary modes of cooking it. Cut one and one-half pounds of salmon
into pieces one inch square; put the pieces in a stewpan with
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]</span><a name='Page_54' id=
"Page_54"></a>half a cupful of water, a little salt, a little white
pepper, one clove, one blade of mace, three pieces of sugar, one
shallot and a heaping teaspoonful of mustard mixed smoothly with
half a teacupful of vinegar. Let this boil up once and add six
tomatoes peeled and cut into tiny pieces, a few sprigs of parsley
finely minced, and one wine-glassful of sherry. Let all simmer
gently for three-quarters of an hour. Serve very hot, and garnish
with dry toast cut in triangular pieces. This dish is good, very
cold, for luncheon or breakfast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALMON PATTIES.</b></p>
<p>Cut cold, cooked salmon into dice. Heat about a pint of the dice
in half a pint of cream. Season to taste with cayenne pepper and
salt. Fill the shells and serve. Cold, cooked fish of any kind may
be made into patties in this way. Use any fish sauce you
choose&mdash;all are equally good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH AND OYSTER PIE.</b></p>
<p>Any remains of cold fish, such as cod or haddock, 2 dozen
oysters, pepper and salt to taste, bread crumbs, sufficient for the
quantity of fish; &frac12; teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, 1
teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley.</p>
<p>Clear the fish from the bones, and put a layer of it in a
pie-dish, which sprinkle with pepper and salt; then a layer of
bread crumbs, oysters, nutmeg and chopped parsley. Repeat this till
the dish is quite full. You may form a covering either of bread
crumbs, which should be browned, or puff-paste, which should be cut
off into long strips, and laid in cross-bars over the fish, with a
line of the paste first laid round the edge. Before putting on the
top, pour in some made melted butter, or a little thin white sauce,
and the oyster-liquor, and bake.</p>
<p><i>Time</i>.&mdash;If of cooked fish, &frac14; hour; if made of
fresh fish and puff-paste, &frac34; hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED FISH.</b></p>
<p>Secure the tail of the fish in its mouth, the body in a circle;
pour over it half a pint of vinegar, seasoned with pepper and salt;
let it stand an hour in a cool place; pour off the vinegar, and put
it in a steamer over boiling water, and steam twenty minutes, or
longer for large fish. When the meat easily separates from the bone
it is done. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]</span><a name='Page_55'
id="Page_55"></a>Drain well and serve on a very clean white napkin,
neatly folded and placed on the platter; decorate the napkin around
the fish with sprigs of curled parsley, or with fanciful beet
cuttings, or alternately with both.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BROIL A SHAD.</b></p>
<p>Split and wash the shad and afterwards dry it in a cloth. Season
it with salt and pepper. Have ready a bed of clear, bright coals.
Grease your gridiron well, and as soon as it is hot, lay the shad
upon it, the flesh side down; cover with a dripping-pan and broil
it for about a quarter of an hour, or more, according to the
thickness. Butter it well and send it to the table. Covering it
while broiling gives it a more delicious flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED SHAD.</b></p>
<p>Many people are of the opinion that the very best method of
cooking a shad is to bake it. Stuff it with bread crumbs, salt,
pepper, butter and parsley, and mix this up with the beaten yolk of
egg; fill the fish with it, and sew it up or fasten a string around
it. Pour over it a little water and some butter, and bake as you
would a fowl. A shad will require from an hour to an hour and a
quarter to bake. Garnish with slices of lemon, water cress,
etc.</p>
<p><i>Dressing for Baked Shad.</i>&mdash;Boil up the gravy in which
the shad was baked, put in a large tablespoonful of catsup, a
tablespoonful of brown flour which has been wet with cold water,
the juice of a lemon, and a glass of sherry or Madeira wine. Serve
in a sauce boat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO COOK A SHAD ROE.</b></p>
<p>Drop into boiling water and cook gently for twenty minutes; then
take from the fire and drain. Butter a tin plate and lay the
drained roe upon it. Dredge well with salt and pepper and spread
soft butter over it; then dredge thickly with flour. Cook in the
oven for half an hour, basting frequently with salt, pepper, flour,
butter and water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO COOK SHAD ROE. (Another Way.)</b></p>
<p>First partly boil them in a small covered pan, take out and
season them with salt, a little pepper, dredge with flour and fry
as any fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED BASS.</b></p>
<p>After thoroughly cleaning it place in a saucepan with enough
water to cover it; add two tablespoonfuls of salt; set the saucepan
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]</span><a name='Page_56' id=
"Page_56"></a>over the fire, and when it has boiled about five
minutes try to pull out one of the fins; if it loosens easily from
the body carefully take the fish out of the water, lay it on a
platter, surround it with half a dozen hard-boiled eggs, and serve
it with a sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED BLUEFISH.</b></p>
<p>Boiled the same as BASS.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED BLUEFISH.</b></p>
<p>Baked the same as BAKED SHAD&mdash;see page 55.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED EELS.</b></p>
<p>After cleaning the eels well, cut them in pieces two inches
long; wash them and wipe them dry; roll them in wheat flour or
rolled cracker, and fry, as directed for other fish, in hot lard or
beef dripping, salted. They should be browned all over and
thoroughly done.</p>
<p>Eels are sometimes dipped in batter and then fried, or into egg
and bread crumbs. Serve with crisped parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SHEEPSHEAD WITH DRAWN BUTTER.</b></p>
<p>Select a medium-sized fish, clean it thoroughly, and rub a
little salt over it; wrap it in a cloth and put it in a steamer;
place this over a pot of fast-boiling water and steam one hour;
then lay it whole upon a hot side-dish, garnish with tufts of
parsley and slices of lemon, and serve with drawn butter, prepared
as follows: Take two ounces of butter and roll it into small balls,
dredge these with flour; put one-fourth of them in a saucepan, and
as they begin to melt, whisk them; add the remainder, one at a
time, until thoroughly smooth; while stirring, add a tablespoonful
of lemon juice, half a tablespoonful of chopped parsley; pour into
a hot sauce boat and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED WHITE FISH.</b></p>
<p>Thoroughly clean the fish; cut off the head or not, as
preferred; cut out the backbone from the head to within two inches
of the tail, and stuff with the following: Soak stale bread in
water, squeeze dry; cut in pieces a large onion, fry in butter,
chop fine; add the bread, two ounces of butter, salt, pepper and a
little parsley or sage; heat through, and when taken off the fire,
add the yolks of two well-beaten <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
57]</span><a name='Page_57' id="Page_57"></a>eggs; stuff the fish
rather full, sew up with fine twine, and wrap with several coils of
white tape. Rub the fish over slightly with butter; just cover the
bottom of a baking pan with hot water, and place the fish in it,
standing back upward, and bent in the form of an S. Serve with the
following dressing: Reduce the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to a
smooth paste with two tablespoonfuls good salad oil; stir in half a
teaspoon English mustard, and add pepper and vinegar to taste.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HALIBUT BOILED.</b></p>
<p>The cut next to the tail-piece is the best to boil. Rub a little
salt over it, soak it for fifteen minutes in vinegar and cold
water, then wash it and scrape it until quite clean; tie it in a
cloth and boil slowly over a moderate fire, allowing seven minutes'
boiling to each pound of fish; when it is half-cooked, turn it over
in the pot; serve with drawn butter or egg sauce.</p>
<p>Boiled halibut minced with boiled potatoes and a little butter
and milk makes an excellent breakfast dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED HALIBUT.</b></p>
<p>Select a three-pound piece of white halibut, cover it with a
cloth and place it in a steamer; set the steamer over a pot of
fast-boiling water and steam two hours; place it on a hot dish
surrounded with a border of parsley and serve with egg sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED HALIBUT. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Select choice, firm slices from this large and delicate looking
fish, and, after carefully washing and drying with a soft towel,
with a sharp knife take off the skin. Beat up two eggs and roll out
some brittle crackers upon the kneading board until they are as
fine as dust. Dip each slice into the beaten egg, then into the
cracker crumbs (after you have salted and peppered the fish), and
place them in a hot frying pan half full of boiling lard, in which
a little butter has been added to make the fish brown nicely; turn
and brown both sides, remove from frying pan and drain. Serve
hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED HALIBUT. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>First fry a few thin slices of salt pork until brown in an iron
frying pan; then take it up on a hot platter and keep it warm until
the halibut is fried. After washing and drying two pounds of sliced
halibut, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]</span><a name='Page_58' id=
"Page_58"></a>sprinkle it with salt and pepper, dredge it well with
flour, put it into the hot pork drippings and fry brown on both
sides; then serve the pork with the fish.</p>
<p>Halibut broiled in slices is a very good way of cooking it,
broiled the same as Spanish mackerel.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED HALIBUT.</b></p>
<p>Take a nice piece of halibut weighing five or six pounds and lay
it in salt water for two hours. Wipe it dry and score the outer
skin. Set it in a dripping pan in a moderately hot oven and bake an
hour, basting often with butter and water heated together in a
sauce pan or tin cup. When a fork will penetrate it easily, it is
done. It should be a fine, brown color. Take the gravy in the
dripping pan, add a little boiling water, should there not be
enough, stir in a tablespoonful of walnut catsup, a teaspoonful of
Worcestershire sauce, the juice of a lemon, and thicken with brown
flour, previously wet with cold water. Boil up once and put in a
sauce boat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HALIBUT BROILED.</b></p>
<p>Broil the same as other fish, upon a buttered gridiron, over a
clear fire, first seasoning with salt and pepper, placed on a hot
dish when done, buttered well and covered closely.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED BROOK TROUT.</b></p>
<p>These delicate fish are usually fried, and form a delightful
breakfast or supper dish. Clean, wash and dry the fish, split them
to the tail, salt and pepper them, and flour them nicely. If you
use lard instead of the fat of fried salt pork, put in a piece of
butter to prevent their sticking, and which causes them to brown
nicely. Let the fat be hot; fry quickly to a delicate brown. They
should be sufficiently browned on one side before turning on the
other. They are nice served with slices of fried pork, fried crisp.
Lay them side by side on a heated platter, garnish and send hot to
the table. They are often cooked and served with their heads
on.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED SMELTS.</b></p>
<p>Fried with their heads on the same as brook trout. Many think
that they make a much better appearance as a dish when cooked whole
with the heads on, and nicely garnished for the table.</p>

<p><b>BOILED WHITE FISH.</b></p>
<div class='right'><i>Taken from Mrs. A. W. Ferry's Cook Book,
Mackinac, 1824.</i></div>
<p>The most delicate mode of cooking white fish. Prepare the fish
as for broiling, laying it open; put it into a dripping pan with
the back down; nearly cover with water; to one fish two
tablespoonfuls of salt; cover tightly and simmer (not boil)
one-half hour. Dress with gravy, a little butter and pepper, and
garnish with hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED WHITE FISH. (Bordeaux Sauce.)</b></p>
<p>Clean and stuff the fish. Put it in a baking pan and add a
liberal quantity of butter, previously rolled in flour, to the
fish. Put in the pan half a pint of claret, and bake for an hour
and a quarter. Remove the fish and strain the gravy; add to the
latter a gill more of claret, a teaspoonful of brown flour and a
pinch of cayenne, and serve with the fish.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Plankington House, Milwaukee.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED SALMON TROUT.</b></p>
<p>This deliciously flavored game-fish is baked precisely as shad
or white fish, but should be accompanied with cream gravy to make
it perfect. It should be baked slowly, basting often with butter
and water. When done have ready in a saucepan a cup of cream,
diluted with a few spoonfuls of hot water, for fear it might clot
in heating, in which have been stirred cautiously two
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a scant tablespoonful of flour,
and a little chopped parsley. Heat this in a vessel set within
another of boiling water, add the gravy from the dripping-pan, boil
up once to thicken, and when the trout is laid on a suitable hot
dish, pour this sauce around it. Garnish with sprigs of
parsley.</p>
<p>This same fish boiled, served with the same cream gravy (with
the exception of the fish gravy), is the proper way to cook it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BAKE SMELTS.</b></p>
<p>Wash and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, and arrange them nicely
in a flat baking-dish; the pan should be buttered, also the fish;
season with salt and pepper, and cover with bread or cracker
crumbs. Place a piece of butter over each. Bake for fifteen or
twenty minutes. Garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]</span><a name='Page_60' id=
"Page_60"></a>
<p><b>BROILED SPANISH MACKEREL.</b></p>
<p>Split the fish down the back, take out the backbone, wash it in
cold water, dry it with a clean, dry cloth, sprinkle it lightly
with salt and lay it on a buttered gridiron, over a clear fire,
with the flesh side downward, until it begins to brown; then turn
the other side. Have ready a mixture of two tablespoonfuls of
butter melted, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, a teaspoonful of
salt, some pepper. Dish up the fish hot from the gridiron on a hot
dish, turn over the mixture and serve it while hot.</p>
<p>Broiled Spanish mackerel is excellent with other fish sauces.
Boiled Spanish mackerel is also very fine with most of the fish
sauces, more especially "Matre d'Hotel Sauce."</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED SALT MACKEREL.</b></p>
<p>Wash and clean off all the brine and salt; put it to soak with
the meat side down, in cold water over night; in the morning rinse
it in one or two waters. Wrap each up in a cloth and put it into a
kettle with considerable water, which should be cold; cook about
thirty minutes. Take it carefully from the cloth, take out the
backbones and pour over a little melted butter and cream; add a
light sprinkle of pepper. Or make a cream sauce like the
following:</p>
<p>Heat a small cup of milk to scalding. Stir into it a teaspoonful
of cornstarch wet up with a little water. When this thickens, add
two tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper, salt and chopped parsley, to
taste. Beat an egg light, pour the sauce gradually over it, put the
mixture again over the fire, and stir one minute, not more. Pour
upon the fish, and serve it with some slices of lemon, or a few
sprigs of parsley or water-cress, on the dish as a garnish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED SALT MACKEREL.</b></p>
<p>When the mackerel have soaked over night, put them in a pan and
pour on boiling water enough to cover. Let them stand a couple of
minutes, then drain them off, and put them in the pan with a few
lumps of butter; pour on a half teacupful of sweet cream, or rich
milk, and a little pepper; set in the oven and let it bake a little
until brown.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]</span><a name='Page_61' id=
"Page_61"></a>
<p><b>FRIED SALT MACKEREL.</b></p>
<p>Select as many salt mackerel as required; wash and cleanse them
well, then put them to soak all day in <i>cold</i> water, changing
them every two hours; then put them into fresh water just before
retiring. In the morning drain off the water, wipe them dry, roll
them in flour, and fry in a little butter on a hot, thick-bottomed
frying pan. Serve with a little melted butter poured over, and
garnish with a little parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED FRESH MACKEREL.</b></p>
<p>Fresh mackerel are cooked in water salted, and a little vinegar
added; with this exception they can be served in the same way as
the salt mackerel. Broiled ones are very nice with the same cream
sauce, or you can substitute egg sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTTED FRESH FISH.</b></p>
<p>After the fish has laid in salt water six hours, take it out,
and to every six pounds of fish take one-quarter cupful each of
salt, black pepper and cinnamon, one-eighth cupful of allspice, and
one teaspoonful of cloves.</p>
<p>Cut the fish in pieces and put into a half gallon stone
baking-jar, first a layer of fish, then the spices, flour, and then
spread a thin layer of butter on, and continue so until the dish is
full. Fill the jar with equal parts of vinegar and water, cover
with tightly fitting lid, so that the steam cannot escape; bake
five hours, remove from the oven, and when it is cold it is to be
cut in slices and served. This is a tea or lunch dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED CRABS.</b></p>
<p>Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling water, and throw in a
handful of salt. Boil from twenty minutes to half an hour. Take
them from the water when done and pick out all the meat; be careful
not to break the shell. To a pint of meat put a little salt and
pepper; taste, and if not enough add more, a little at a time, till
suited. Grate in a very little nutmeg and add one spoonful of
cracker or bread crumbs, two eggs well beaten, and two
tablespoonfuls of butter (even full); stir all well together; wash
the shells clean, and fill each shell full of the mixture; sprinkle
crumbs over the top and moisten with the liquor; set in the oven
till of a nice brown; a few minutes will do it. Send to the table
hot, arranged on large dishes. They are eaten at breakfast or
supper.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]</span><a name='Page_62' id=

<p><b>FISH IN WHITE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Flake up cold boiled halibut and set the plate into the steamer,
that the fish may heat without drying. Boil the bones and skin of
the fish with a slice of onion and a <i>very</i> small piece of red
pepper; a bit of this the size of a kernel of coffee will make the
sauce quite as hot as most persons like it. Boil this stock down to
half a pint; thicken with one teaspoonful of butter and one
teaspoonful of flour, mixed together. Add one drop of extract of
almond. Pour this sauce over your halibut and stick bits of parsley
over it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRESH STURGEON STEAK MARINADE.</b></p>
<p>Take one slice of sturgeon two inches thick; let it stand in hot
water five minutes; drain, put it in a bowl and add a gill of
vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoonful of
salt, a saltspoonful of black pepper and the juice of half a lemon;
let it stand six hours, turning it occasionally; drain and dry on a
napkin; dip it in egg; roll in bread crumbs and fry, or rather
boil, in very hot fat. Beat up the yolks of two raw eggs, add a
teaspoonful of French mustard, and by degrees, half of the
marinade, to make a smooth sauce, which serve with the fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTTED FISH.</b></p>
<p>Take out the backbone of the fish; for one weighing two pounds
take a tablespoonful of allspice and cloves mixed; these spices
should be put into little bags of not too thick muslin; put
sufficient salt directly upon each fish; then roll in cloth, over
which sprinkle a little cayenne pepper; put alternate layers of
fish, spice and sage in an earthen jar; cover with the best cider
vinegar; cover the jar closely with a plate, and over this, put a
covering of dough, rolled out to twice the thickness of pie crust.
Make the edges of paste, to adhere closely to the sides of the jar,
so as to make it air tight. Put the jar into a pot of cold water
and let it boil from three to five hours, according to quantity.
Ready when cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MAYONNAISE FISH.</b></p>
<p>Take a pound or so of cold boiled fish (halibut, rock or cod),
not chop, but cut, into pieces an inch in length. Mix in a bowl a
dressing as follows: The yolks of four boiled eggs rubbed to a
smooth paste with salad oil or butter; add to these salt, pepper,
mustard, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]</span><a name='Page_63' id=
"Page_63"></a>two teaspoonfuls of white sugar, and, lastly, six
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Beat the mixture until light, and just
before pouring it over the fish, stir in lightly the frothed white
of a raw egg. Serve the fish in a glass dish, with half the
dressing stirred in with it. Spread the remainder over the top, and
lay lettuce leaves (from the core of the head of lettuce) around
the edges, to be eaten with it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH CHOWDER. (Rhode Island.)</b></p>
<p>Fry five or six slices of fat pork crisp in the bottom of the
pot you are to make your chowder in; take them out and chop them
into small pieces, put them back into the bottom of the pot with
their own gravy. (This is much better than having the slices
whole.)</p>
<p>Cut four pounds of fresh cod or sea-bass into pieces two inches
square, and lay enough of these on the pork to cover it. Follow
with a layer of chopped onions, a little parsley, summer savory and
pepper, either black or cayenne. Then a layer of split Boston, or
butter, or whole cream crackers, which have been soaked in warm
water until moistened through, but not ready to break. Above this
put a layer of pork and repeat the order given above&mdash;onions,
seasoning (not too much), crackers and pork, until your materials
are exhausted. Let the topmost layer be buttered crackers well
soaked. Pour in enough cold water to barely cover all. Cover the
pot, stew gently for an hour, watching that the water does not sink
too low. Should it leave the upper layer exposed, replenish
cautiously from the boiling tea-kettle. When the chowder is
thoroughly done, take out with a perforated skimmer and put into a
tureen. Thicken the gravy with a tablespoonful of flour and about
the same quantity of butter; boil up and pour over the chowder.
Serve sliced lemon, pickles and stewed tomatoes with it, that the

<br>
<p><b>CODFISH BALLS.</b></p>
<p>Take a pint bowl of codfish picked very fine, two pint bowls of
whole raw peeled potatoes, sliced thickly; put them together in
plenty of cold water and boil until the potatoes are thoroughly
cooked; remove from the fire and drain off all the water. Mash them
with the potato masher, add a piece of butter the size of an egg,
one well-beaten egg, and three spoonfuls of cream or rich milk.
Flour your hands and make into balls or cakes. Put an ounce each of
butter <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]</span><a name='Page_64' id=
"Page_64"></a>and lard into a frying pan; when hot, put in the
balls and fry a nice brown. Do not freshen the fish before boiling
with the potatoes. Many cooks fry them in a quantity of lard
similar to boiled doughnuts.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED CODFISH. (Salt.)</b></p>
<p>Take a thick, white piece of salt codfish, lay it in cold water
for a few minutes to soften it a little, enough to render it more
easily to be picked up. Shred it in very small bits, put it over
the fire in a stew pan with cold water; let it come to a boil, turn
off this water carefully, and add a pint of milk to the fish, or
more according to quantity. Set it over the fire again and let it
boil slowly about three minutes, now add a good-sized piece of
butter, a shake of pepper and a thickening of a tablespoonful of
flour in enough cold milk to make a cream. Stew five minutes
longer, and just before serving stir in two well-beaten eggs. The
eggs are an addition that could be dispensed with, however, as it
is very good without them. An excellent breakfast dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CODFISH A LA MODE.</b></p>
<p>Pick up a teacupful of salt codfish very fine and
freshen&mdash;the desiccated is nice to use; two cups mashed
potatoes, one pint cream or milk, two well-beaten eggs, half a cup
butter, salt and pepper; mix; bake in an earthen baking dish from
twenty to twenty-five minutes; serve in the same dish, placed on a
small platter, covered with a fine napkin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED FRESH COD.</b></p>
<p>Sew up the piece of fish in thin cloth, fitted to shape; boil in
salted water (boiling from the first), allowing about fifteen
minutes to the pound. Carefully unwrap and pour over it warm oyster
sauce. A whole one boiled the same.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Hotel Brighton.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED FISH.</b></p>
<p>Pick any cold fresh fish, or salt codfish, left from the dinner,
into fine bits, carefully removing all the bones.</p>
<p>Take a pint of milk in a suitable dish and place it in a
saucepan of boiling water; put into it a few slices of onion cut
very fine, a sprig of parsley minced fine, add a piece of butter as
large as an egg, a pinch <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
65]</span><a name='Page_65' id="Page_65"></a>of salt, a sprinkle of
white pepper, then stir in two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, or
flour, rubbed in a little cold milk; let all boil up and remove
from the fire. Take a dish you wish to serve it in, butter the
sides and bottom. Put first a layer of the minced fish, then a
layer of the cream, then sprinkle over that some cracker or bread
crumbs, then a layer of fish again, and so on until the dish is
full; spread cracker or bread crumbs last on the top to prevent the
milk from scorching.</p>
<p>This is a very good way to use up cold fish, making a nice
breakfast dish, or a side dish for dinner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Take a piece of salt codfish, pick it up very fine, put it into
a saucepan, with plenty of <i>cold</i> water; bring it to a boil,
turn off the water, and add another of cold water; let this boil
with the fish about fifteen minutes, very slowly; strain off this
water, making the fish quite dry, and set aside to cool. In the
meantime, stir up a batter of a pint of milk, four eggs, a pinch of
salt, one large teaspoonful of baking powder in flour, enough to
make thicker than batter cakes. Stir in the fish and fry like any
fritters. Very fine accompaniment to a good breakfast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED SALT CODFISH. (New England Style.)</b></p>
<p>Cut the fish into square pieces, cover with cold water, set on
the back part of the stove; when hot, pour off water and cover
again with cold water; let it stand about four hours and simmer,
not boil; put the fish on a platter, then cover with a drawn-butter
gravy and serve. Many cooks prefer soaking the fish over night.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED CODFISH AND OYSTER SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Lay the fish in cold, salted water half an hour before it is
time to cook it, then roll it in a clean cloth dredged with flour;
sew up the edges in such a manner as to envelop the fish entirely,
yet have but <i>one</i> thickness of cloth over any part. Put the
fish into boiling water slightly salted; add a few whole cloves and
peppers and a bit of lemon peel; pull gently on the fins, and when
they come out easily the fish is done. Arrange neatly on a folded
napkin, garnish and serve with <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
66]</span><a name='Page_66' id="Page_66"></a>oyster sauce. Take six
oysters to every pound of fish and scald (blanch) them in a
half-pint of hot oyster liquor; take out the oysters and add to the
liquor, salt, pepper, a bit of mace and an ounce of butter; whip
into it a gill of milk containing half of a teaspoonful of flour.
Simmer a moment; add the oysters, and send to table in a sauce
boat. Egg sauce is good with this fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED CODFISH.</b></p>
<p>If salt fish, soak, boil and pick the fish, the same as for
fish-balls. Add an equal quantity of mashed potatoes, or cold,
boiled, chopped potatoes, a large piece of butter, and warm milk
enough to make it quite soft. Put it into a buttered dish, rub
butter over the top, shake over a little sifted flour, and bake
about thirty minutes, and until a rich brown. Make a sauce of drawn
butter, with two hard-boiled eggs sliced, served in a gravy
boat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CODFISH STEAK. (New England Style.)</b></p>
<p>Select a medium-sized fresh codfish, cut it in steaks crosswise
of the fish, about an inch and a half thick; sprinkle a little salt
over them, and let them stand two hours. Cut into dice a pound of
salt fat pork, fry out all the fat from them and remove the crisp
bits of pork; put the codfish steaks in a pan of corn meal, dredge
them with it, and when the pork fat is smoking hot, fry the steaks
in it to a dark brown color on both sides. Squeeze over them a
little lemon juice, add a dash of freshly ground pepper, and serve
with hot, old-fashioned, well-buttered Johnny Cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALMON CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>One pound of cooked salmon (about one and a half pints when
chopped), one cup of cream, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one
tablespoonful of flour, three eggs, one pint of crumbs, pepper and
salt; chop the salmon fine, mix the flour and butter together, let
the cream come to a boil, and stir in the flour and butter, salmon
and seasoning; boil one minute; stir in one well-beaten egg, and
remove from the fire; when cold make into croquettes; dip in beaten
egg, roll in crumbs and fry. Canned salmon can be used.</p>

<h2><b>SHELL-FISH</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED WATER TURTLES, OR TERRAPINS.</b></p>
<p>Select the largest, thickest and fattest, the females being the
best; they should be alive when brought from market. Wash and put
them alive into boiling water, add a little salt, and boil them
until thoroughly done, or from ten to fifteen minutes, after which
take off the shell, extract the meat, and remove carefully the
sand-bag and gall; also all the entrails; they are unfit to eat,
and are no longer used in cooking terrapins for the best tables.
Cut the meat into pieces, and put it into a stewpan with its eggs,
and sufficient fresh butter to stew it well. Let it stew till quite
hot throughout, keeping the pan carefully covered, that none of the
flavor may escape, but shake it over the fire while stewing. In
another pan make a sauce of beaten yolk of egg, highly flavored
with Madeira or sherry, and powdered nutmeg and mace, a gill of
currant jelly, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt to taste,
enriched with a large lump of fresh butter. Stir this sauce well
over the fire, and when it has almost come to a boil take it off.
Send the terrapins to the table hot in a covered dish, and the
sauce separately in a sauce tureen, to be used by those who like
it, and omitted by those who prefer the genuine flavor of the
terrapins when simply stewed with butter. This is now the usual
mode of dressing terrapins in Maryland, Virginia, and many other
parts of the South, and will be found superior to any other. If
there are no eggs in the terrapin, "egg balls" may be substituted.
(See recipe.)</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED TERRAPIN, WITH CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Place in a saucepan, two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter and
one of dry flour; stir it over the fire until it bubbles; then
gradually stir in a pint of cream, a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter
of a teaspoonful of white pepper, the same of grated nutmeg, and a
very small pinch of cayenne. Next, put in a pint of terrapin meat
and stir all until it is scalding hot. Move the saucepan to the
back part of the stove or range, where the contents will keep hot
but not boil; then stir in four <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
68]</span><a name='Page_68' id="Page_68"></a>well-beaten yolks of
eggs; do not allow the terrapin to boil after adding the eggs, but
pour it immediately into a tureen containing a gill of good Madeira
and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED TERRAPIN.</b></p>
<p>Plunge the terrapins alive into boiling water, and let them
remain until the sides and lower shell begin to crack&mdash;this
will take less than an hour; then remove them and let them get
cold; take off the shell and outer skin, being careful to save all
the blood possible in opening them. If there are eggs in them put
them aside in a dish; take all the inside out, and be very careful
not to break the gall, which must be immediately removed or it will
make the rest bitter. It lies within the liver. Then cut up the
liver and all the rest of the terrapin into small pieces, adding
the blood and juice that have flowed out in cutting up; add half a
pint of water; sprinkle a little flour over them as you place them
in the stewpan; let them stew slowly ten minutes, adding salt,
black and cayenne pepper, and a very small blade of mace; then add
a gill of the best brandy and half a pint of the very best sherry
wine; let it simmer over a slow fire very gently. About ten minutes
or so, before you are ready to dish them, add half a pint of rich
cream, and half a pound of sweet butter, with flour, to prevent
boiling; two or three minutes before taking them off the fire peel
the eggs carefully and throw them in whole. If there should be no
eggs use the yolks of hens' eggs, hard boiled. This recipe is for
four terrapins.</p>

<h3>BASTING THE TURKEY.</h3>
<br>
<p><b>OILED LOBSTER.</b></p>
<p>Put a handful of salt into a large kettle or pot of boiling
water. When the water boils very hard put in the lobster, having
first brushed it and tied the claws together with a bit of twine.
Keep it boiling from twenty minutes to half an hour, in proportion
to its size. If boiled too long the meat will be hard and stringy.
When it is done take it out, lay it on its claws to drain, and then
wipe it dry.</p>
<p>It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head of a lobster
and what are called the lady fingers are not to be eaten.</p>
<p>Very large lobsters are not the best, the meat being coarse and
tough. The male is best for boiling; the flesh is firmer and the
shell a brighter red. It may readily be distinguished from the
female; <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]</span><a name='Page_69' id=
"Page_69"></a>the tail is narrower, and the two uppermost fins
within the tail are stiff and hard. Those of the hen lobster are
not so, and the tail is broader.</p>
<p>Hen lobsters are preferred for sauce or salad, on account of
their coral. The head and small claws are never used.</p>
<p>They should be alive and freshly caught when put into the
boiling kettle. After being cooked and cooled, split open the body
and tail and crack the claws, to extract the meat. The sand pouch
found near the throat should be removed. Care should be exercised
that none of the feathery, tough, gill-like particles found under
the body shell get mixed with the meat, as they are indigestible
and have caused much trouble. They are supposed to be the cause of
so-called poisoning from eating lobster.</p>
<p>Serve on a platter. Lettuce and other concomitants of a salad
should also be placed on the table or platter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED LOBSTER.</b></p>
<p>Butter a deep dish and cover the bottom with fine bread crumbs;
put on this a layer of chopped lobster, with pepper and salt; so
on, alternately, until the dish is filled, having crumbs on top.
Put on bits of butter, moisten with milk and bake about twenty
minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DEVILED LOBSTER.</b></p>
<p>Take out all the meat from a boiled lobster, reserving the
coral; season highly with mustard, cayenne, salt and some kind of
table sauce; stew until well mixed and put it in a covered
saucepan, with just enough hot water to keep from burning; rub the
coral smooth, moistening with vinegar until it is thin enough to
pour easily, then stir it into the saucepan. The dressing should be
prepared before the meat is put on the fire, and which ought to
boil but once before the coral is put in; stir in a heaping
teaspoonful of butter, and when it boils again it is done and
should be taken up at once, as too much cooking toughens the
meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LOBSTER CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>Take any of the lobster remaining from table and pound it until
the dark, light meat and coral are well mixed; put with it not
quite as much fine bread crumbs; season with pepper, salt and a
very little <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 70]</span><a name='Page_70'
id="Page_70"></a>cayenne pepper; add a little melted butter, about
two tablespoonfuls if the bread is rather dry; form into egg-shaped
or round balls; roll them in egg, then in fine crumbs, and fry in
boiling lard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LOBSTER PATTIES.</b></p>
<p>Cut some boiled lobster in small pieces; then take the small
claws and the spawn, put them in a suitable dish, and jam them to a
paste with a potato masher. Now add to them a ladleful of gravy or
broth, with a few bread crumbs; set it over the fire and boil;
strain it through a strainer, or sieve, to the thickness of a
cream, and put half of it to your lobsters, and save the other half
to sauce them with after they are baked. Put to the lobster the
bigness of an egg of butter, a little pepper and salt; squeeze in a
lemon, and warm these over the fire enough to melt the butter, set
it to cool, and sheet your patty pan or a plate or dish with good
puff paste, then put in your lobster, and cover it with a paste;
bake it within three-quarters of an hour before you want it; when
it is baked, cut up your cover, and warm up the other half of your
sauce above mentioned, with a little butter, to the thickness of
cream, and pour it over your patty, with a little squeezed lemon;
cut your cover in two, and lay it on the top, two inches distant,
so that what is under may be seen. You may bake crawfish, shrimps
or prawns the same way; and they are all proper for plates or
little dishes for a second course.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LOBSTER &Aacute; LA NEWBURG.</b></p>
<p>Take one whole lobster, cut up in pieces about as large as a
hickory nut. Put in the same pan with a piece of butter size of a
walnut, season with salt and pepper to taste, and thicken with
heavy cream sauce; add the yolk of one egg and two oz. of sherry
wine.</p>
<p>Cream sauce for above is made as follows: 1 oz. butter, melted
in saucepan; 2 oz. flour, mixed with butter, thin down to proper
consistency with boiling cream.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Rector's Oyster House, Chicago.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED CRABS.</b></p>
<p>Mix with the contents of a can of crabs, bread crumbs or pounded
crackers. Pepper and salt the whole to taste; mince some cold ham;
have the baking pan well buttered, place therein first a layer of
the crab meat, prepared as above, then a layer of the minced ham,
and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]</span><a name='Page_71' id=
"Page_71"></a>so on, alternately until the pan is filled. Cover the
top with bread crumbs and bits of butter, and bake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DEVILED CRABS.</b></p>
<p>Half a dozen fresh crabs, boiled and minced, two ounces of
butter, one small teaspoonful of mustard powder; cayenne pepper and
salt to taste. Put the meat into a bowl and mix carefully with it
an equal quantity of fine bread crumbs. Work the butter to a light
cream, mix the mustard well with it, then stir in very carefully, a
handful at a time, the mixed crabs, a tablespoonful of cream and
crumbs. Season to taste with cayenne pepper and salt; fill the crab
shells with the mixture, sprinkle bread crumbs over the tops, put
three small pieces of butter upon the top of each, and brown them
quickly in a hot oven. They will puff in baking and will be found
very nice. Half the quantity can be made. A crab shell will hold
the meat of two crabs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRAB CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>Pick the meat of boiled crabs and chop it fine. Season to taste
with pepper, salt and melted butter. Moisten it well with rich milk
or cream, then stiffen it slightly with bread or cracker crumbs.
Add two or three well-beaten eggs to bind the mixture. Form the
croquettes, egg and bread, crumb them and fry them delicately in
boiling lard. It is better to use a wire frying basket for
croquettes of all kinds.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE A CRAB PIE.</b></p>
<p>Procure the crabs alive, and put them in boiling water, along
with some salt. Boil them for a quarter of an hour or twenty
minutes, according to the size. When cold pick the meat from the
claws and body. Chop all together, and mix it with crumbs of bread,
pepper and salt, and a little butter. Put all this into the shell
and brown in a hot oven. A crab shell will hold the meat of two
crabs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRABS. (Soft Shell.)</b></p>
<p>Crabs may be boiled as lobsters. They make a fine dish when
stewed. Take out the meat from the shell, put it into a saucepan
with butter, pepper, salt, a pinch of mace and a very little water;
dredge with flour and let simmer five minutes over a slow fire.
Serve hot; garnish the dish with the claws laid around it.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]</span><a name='Page_72' id=
"Page_72"></a>
<p>The usual way of cooking them is frying them in plenty of butter
and lard mixed; prepare them the same as frying fish. The spongy
substance from the sides should be taken off, also the sand bag.
Fry a nice brown and garnish with parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Oysters must be fresh and fat to be good. They are in season
from September to May.</p>
<p>The small ones, such as are sold by the quart, are good for
pies, fritters, or stews; the largest of this sort are nice for
frying or pickling for family use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Take large oysers from their own liquor into a thickly folded
napkin to dry them; then make hot an ounce each of butter and lard
in a thick-bottomed frying pan. Season the oysters with pepper and
salt, then dip each one into egg and cracker crumbs rolled fine,
until it will take up no more. Place them in the hot grease and fry
them a delicate brown, turning them on both sides by sliding a
broad-bladed knife under them. Serve them crisp and hot.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Boston Oyster House.</i></div>
<p>Some prefer to roll oysters in corn meal and others use flour,
but they are much more crisp with egg and cracker crumbs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTERS FRIED IN BATTER.</b></p>
<p><i>Ingredients.</i>&mdash;One-half pint of oysters, two eggs,
one-half pint of milk, sufficient flour to make the batter; pepper
and salt to taste; when liked, a little nutmeg; hot lard.</p>
<p>Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, and lay them
on a cloth to drain thoroughly. Break the eggs into a basin, mix
the flour with them, add the milk gradually, with nutmeg and
seasoning, and put the oysters in a batter. Make some lard hot in a
deep frying pan; put in the oysters one at a time; when done, take
them up with a sharp pointed skewer and dish them on a napkin.
Fried oysters are frequently used for garnishing boiled fish, and
then a few bread crumbs should be added to the flour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED OYSTERS. (In Milk or Cream.)</b></p>
<p>Drain the liquor from two quarts of oysters; mix with it a small
teacupful of hot water, add a little salt and pepper and set it
over <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]</span><a name='Page_73' id=
"Page_73"></a>the fire in a saucepan. Let it boil up once, put in
the oysters, let them come to a boil, and when they "ruffle" add
two tablespoonfuls of butter. The instant it is melted and well
stirred in, put in a pint of boiling milk and take the saucepan
from the fire. Serve with oyster or cream crackers. Serve while
hot.</p>
<p>If thickening is preferred, stir in a little flour or two
tablespoonfuls of cracker crumbs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN OYSTER STEW.</b></p>
<p>Same as milk or cream stew, using only oyster liquor and water
instead of milk or cream, adding more butter after taking up.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER SOUP.</b></p>
<p>For oyster soup, see SOUPS.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRY OYSTER STEW.</b></p>
<p>Take six to twelve large oysters and cook them in half a pint of

five minutes, stirring constantly. Serve in hot soup plates or
bowls.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Fulton Market, New York.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>BOSTON FRY.</b></p>
<p>Prepare the oysters in egg batter and fine cracker meal; fry in

a hot platter with tomato sauce; place the oysters in it, but not
covering; garnished with chopped parsley sprinkled over the
oysters.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Boston Oyster House.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Dry a quart of oysters in a cloth, dip each in melted butter

crumbs also peppered. Broil on a wire broiler over live coals three
to five minutes. Dip over each a little melted butter. Serve
hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST OYSTERS IN THE SHELL. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Select the large ones, those usually termed "Saddle Rocks,"
formerly known as a distinct variety, but which are now but the
large oysters selected from any beds; wash and wipe them, and place
with the upper or deep shell down, to catch the juice, over or on
live coals. When they open their shells, remove the shallow one,
being careful to <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span><a name=
'Page_74' id="Page_74"></a>save all the juice in the other; place
them, shells and all, on a hot platter, and send to the table hot
to be seasoned by each person with butter and pepper to taste. If
the oysters are fine, and they are just cooked enough and served
hot, this is, <i>par excellence</i>, the style.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER ROAST. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Put one quart of oysters in a basin with their own liquor and
let them boil three or four minutes; season with a little salt,
pepper and a heaping spoonful of butter. Serve on buttered
toast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Wash and drain a quart of counts or select oysters; put them in
a shallow pan and place in a steamer over boiling water; cover and
steam till they are plump, with the edges ruffled, but no longer.
Place to a heated dish, with butter, pepper, and salt, and
serve.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Baltimore Style</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED OYSTERS IN THE SHELL.</b></p>
<p>Wash and place them in an air-tight vessel, laying them the
upper shell downward, so that the liquor will not run out when they
open. Place this dish or vessel over a pot of boiling water where
they will get the steam. Boil them rapidly until the shells open,
about fifteen to twenty minutes. Serve at once while hot, seasoned
with butter, salt and pepper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PAN OYSTERS. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Cut some stale bread into thin slices, taking off all the crust,
round the slices to fit patty-pans; toast, butter, place them in
the pans and moisten with three or four teaspoonfuls of oyster
liquor; place on the toast a layer of oysters, sprinkle with
pepper, and put a small piece of butter on top of each pan; place
all the pans in a baking-pan, and place in the oven, covering
tightly. They will cook in seven or eight minutes if the oven is
hot; or, cook till the beards are ruffled; remove the cover,
sprinkle lightly with salt, replace, and cook one minute longer.
Serve in patty pans. They are delicious.</p>
<div class='right'><i>New York Style.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>PAN OYSTERS. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Lay in a thin pie tin or dripping-pan, half a pint of large
oysters, or more if required; have the pan large enough so that
each oyster will lie flat on the bottom; put in over them a little
oyster liquor, but <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]</span><a name=
'Page_75' id="Page_75"></a>not enough to float; place them
carefully in a hot oven and just heat them through
thoroughly&mdash;do not bake them&mdash;which will be in three to
five minutes, according to fire; take them up and place on toast;
first moistened with the hot juice from the pan. Are a very good
substitute for oysters roasted in the shell, the slow cooking
bringing out the flavor.</p>
<div class='right'><i>French Restaurant, New Orleans, La.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Select plump, good-sized oysters; drain off the juice, and to a
cup of this juice add a cup of milk, a little salt, four
well-beaten eggs, and flour enough to make batter like
griddle-cakes.</p>
<p>Envelope an oyster in a spoonful of this batter (some cut them
in halves or chop them fine), then fry in butter and lard, mixed in
a frying pan the same as we fry eggs, turning to fry brown on both
sides. Send to the table very hot.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Delmonico.</i></div>

<p>Line patty-pans with thin pastry, pressing it well to the tin.
Put a piece of bread or a ball of paper in each. Cover them with
paste and brush them over with the white of an egg. Cut an inch
square of thin pastry, place on the centre of each, glaze this also
with egg, and bake in a quick oven fifteen to twenty minutes.
Remove the bread or paper when half cold.</p>
<p>Scald as many oysters as you require (allowing two for each
patty, three if small) in their own liquor. Cut each in four and
strain the liquor. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and two of
flour into a thick saucepan; stir them together over the fire till
the flour smells cooked, and then pour half a pint of oyster liquor
and half a pint of milk into the flour and butter. (If you have
cream use it instead of milk.) Stir till it is a thick, smooth
sauce. Put the oysters into it and let them boil once. Beat the
yolks of two eggs. Remove the oysters for one minute from the fire,
then stir the eggs into them till the sauce looks like thick
custard.</p>

<p>Fill the patties with this oyster fricassee, taking care to make
it hot by standing in boiling water before dinner on the day
required, and to make the patty cases hot before you fill them.</p>

<p><b>FULTON MARKET ROAST.</b></p>
<p>It is still known in New York from the place at which it was and
is still served. Take nine large oysters out of the shell; wash,
dry and roast over a charcoal fire, on a broiler. Two minutes after
the shells open they will be done. Take them off quickly, saving
the juice in a small shallow, tin pan; keep hot until all are done;
butter them and sprinkle with pepper.</p>
<p>This is served for one person when calling for a roast of this
kind. It is often poured over a slice of toast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Have ready about a pint of fine cracker crumbs. Butter a deep
earthen dish; put a layer of the cracker crumbs on the bottom; wet
this with some of the oyster liquor; next have a layer of oysters;
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and lay small bits of butter upon
them; then add another layer of cracker crumbs and oyster juice;
then oysters, pepper, salt and butter, and so on, until the dish is
full; the top layer to be cracker crumbs. Beat up an egg in a cup
of milk and turn over all. Cover the dish and set it in the oven
for thirty or forty-five minutes. When baked through, uncover the
top, set on the upper grate and brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER POT-PIE.</b></p>
<p>Scald a quart can of oysters in their own liquor; when it boils,
skim out the oysters and set them aside in a warm place. To the
liquor add a pint of hot water; season well with salt and pepper, a
generous piece of butter, thicken with flour and cold milk. Have
ready nice light biscuit dough, rolled twice as thick as pie crust;
cut out into inch squares, drop them into the boiling stew, cover
closely, and cook forty minutes. When taken up, stir the oysters
into the juice and serve all together in one dish. A nice side

<p><b>BOSTON OYSTER PIE.</b></p>
<p>Having buttered the inside of a <i>deep</i> pie plate, line it
with puff paste, or common pie crust, and prepare another sheet of
paste for the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 77]</span><a name='Page_77'
id="Page_77"></a>lid; put a clean towel into the dish (folded so as
to support the lid), set it into the oven and bake the paste well;
when done, remove the lid and take out the towel. While the paste
is baking, prepare the oysters. Having picked off carefully every
bit of shell that may be found about them, drain the liquor into a
pan and put the oysters into a stewpan with barely enough of the
liquor to keep them from burning; season them with pepper, salt and
butter; add a little sweet cream or milk, and one or two crackers
rolled fine; let the oysters simmer, but <i>not boil</i>, as that
will shrivel them. Remove the upper crust of pastry and fill the
dish with the oysters and gravy. Replace the cover and serve
hot.</p>
<p>Some prefer baking the upper crust on a pie plate, the same size
as the pie, then slipping it off on top of the pie after the same
pie is filled with the oysters.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOCK OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Grate the corn, while green and tender, with a coarse grater,
into a deep dish. For two ears of corn, allow one egg; beat the
whites and yolks separately, and add them to the corn, with one
tablespoonful of wheat flour and one of butter, a teaspoonful of
salt and pepper to taste. Drop spoonfuls of this batter into a
frying pan with hot butter and lard mixed, and fry a light brown on
both sides.</p>
<p>In taste, they have a singular resemblance to fried oysters. The
corn <i>must</i> be <i>young</i>.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRICASSEED OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Take a slice of raw ham, which has been pickled, but not smoked,
and soak in boiling water for half an hour; cut it in quite small
pieces, and put in a saucepan with two-thirds of a pint of veal or
chicken broth, well strained; the liquor from a quart of oysters,
one small onion, minced fine, a little chopped parsley, sweet
marjoram, and pepper; let them simmer for twenty minutes, and then
boil rapidly for two or three minutes; skim well and add one scant
tablespoon of cornstarch, mixed smoothly in one-third cup of milk;
stir constantly, and when it boils add the oysters and one ounce of
butter; after which, just let it come to a boil, and remove the
oysters to a deep dish; beat one egg, and add to it gradually some
of the hot broth, and, when cooked, stir it into the pan; season
with salt, and pour the whole over the oysters. When placed upon
the table, squeeze the juice of a lemon over it.</p>

<p><b>Small Oyster Pies.</b></p>
<p>For each pie take a tin plate half the size of an ordinary
dinner plate; butter it, and cover the bottom with a puff paste, as
for pies; lay on it five or six select oysters, or enough to cover
the bottom; butter them and season with a little salt and plenty of
pepper; spread over this an egg batter, and cover with a crust of
the paste, making small openings in it with a fork. Bake in a hot
oven fifteen to twenty minutes, or until the top is nicely
browned.</p>

<p><b>STEWED CLAMS.</b></p>
<p>Wash clean as many round clams as required; pile them in a large
iron pot, with half a cupful of hot water in the bottom, and put
over the fire; as soon as the shells open take out the clams, cut
off the hard, uneatable "fringe" from each with strong, clean
scissors, put them into a stewpan with the broth from the pot, and
boil slowly till they are quite tender; pepper well and thicken the
gravy with flour stirred into melted butter.</p>
<p>Or, you may get two dozen freshly opened <i>very</i> small
clams. Boil a pint of milk, a dash of white pepper and a small pat
of butter. Now add the clams. Let them come to a boil and serve.
Longer boiling will make the clams almost indigestible.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST CLAMS IN THE SHELL.</b></p>
<p>Roast in a pan over a hot fire, or in a hot oven, or, at a "Clam
Bake," on hot stones; when they open, empty the juice into a

<p><b>CLAM FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Take fifty small or twenty-five large sand clams from their
shells; if large, cut each in two, lay them on a thickly-folded
napkin; put a pint bowl of wheat flour into a basin, add to it
three well-beaten eggs, half a pint of sweet milk and nearly as
much of their own liquor; beat the batter until it is smooth and
perfectly free from lumps, then stir in the clams. Put plenty of
lard or beef fat into a thick-bottomed frying pan, let it become
boiling hot; put in the batter by the spoonful; let them fry
gently; when one side is a delicate brown turn the other.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 79]</span><a name='Page_79' id=

<p><b>CLAM CHOWDER.</b></p>
<p>The materials needed are fifty round clams (quahogs), a large
bowl of salt pork cut up fine, the same of onions finely chopped,
and the same (or more, if you desire) of potatoes cut into eighths
or sixteenths of original size; wash the clams very thoroughly and
put them in a pot with half a pint of water; when the shells are
open they are done; then take them from the shells and chop fine,
saving all the clam water for the chowder; fry out the pork very
gently, and when the scraps are a good brown take them out and put
in the chopped onions to fry; they should be fried in a frying pan,
and the chowder kettle be made very clean before they are put in
it, or the chowder will burn. (The chief secret in chowder-making
is to fry the onions so delicately that they will be missing in the
chowder.)</p>
<p>Add a quart of hot water to the onions; put in the clams,
clam-water and pork scraps. After it boils, add the potatoes, and
when they are cooked, the chowder is finished. Just before it is
taken up, thicken it with a cup of powdered crackers, and add a
quart of fresh milk. If too rich, add more water. No seasoning is
needed but good black pepper.</p>
<p>With the addition of six sliced tomatoes, or half a can of the
canned ones, this is the best recipe of this kind, and is served in
many of our best restaurants.</p>
<div class='right'><i>New Bedford Recipe</i></div>

<p><b>SCALLOPED CLAMS.</b></p>
<p>Purchase a dozen large soft clams in the shell and three dozen
opened clams. Ask the dealer to open the first dozen, care being
used not to injure the shells, which are to be used in cooking the
clams. Clean the shells well, and put two soft clams on each half
shell; add to each a dash of white pepper, and half a teaspoonful
of minced celery. Cut a slice of fat bacon into the smallest dice,
add four of these to each shell, strew over the top a thin layer of
cracker dust; place a piece of table butter on top, and bake in the
oven until brown. They are delightful when properly prepared.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPS.</b></p>
<p>If bought in the shell boil them and take out the hearts, which
is the only part used. Dip them in beaten egg and fry in the same

<p><b>FROGS STEWED.</b></p>
<p>Wash and skin the quarters, parboil them about three minutes,
drain them. Now put into a stewpan two ounces of butter. When it is
melted, lay in the frogs, and fry about two minutes, stirring them
to prevent burning; shake over them a tablespoonful of sifted flour
and stir it into them; add a sprig of parsley, a pinch of powdered
summer savory, a bay leaf, three slices of onion, salt and pepper,
a cup of hot water and one of cream. Boil gently until done; remove
the legs, strain and mix into the gravy the yolks of two eggs, well
beaten to a cream; put the legs in a suitable dish, pour over the

<a name='POULTRY_AND_GAME' id="POULTRY_AND_GAME"></a>
<h2><b>POULTRY AND GAME</b></h2>
<br>
<p>In choosing poultry, select those that are fresh and fat, and
the surest way to determine whether they are young is to try the
skin under the leg or wing. If it is easily broken, it is young;
or, turn the wing backwards, if the joint yields readily, it is
tender. When poultry is young the skin is thin and tender, the legs
smooth, the feet moist and limber, and the eyes full and bright.
The body should be thick and the breast fat. Old turkeys have long
hairs, and the flesh is purplish where it shows under the skin on
the legs and back. About March they deteriorate in quality.</p>
<p>Young ducks and geese are plump, with light, semi-transparent
fat, soft breast bone, tender flesh, leg-joints which will break by
the weight of the bird, fresh-colored and brittle beaks, and
windpipes that break when pressed between the thumb and forefinger.
They are best in fall and winter.</p>
<p>Young pigeons have light red flesh upon the breast, and full,
fresh-colored legs; when the legs are thin and the breast very dark
the birds are old.</p>
<p>Fine game birds are always heavy for their size; the flesh of
the breast is firm and plump and the skin clear; and if a few
feathers be plucked from the inside of the leg and around the vent,
the flesh of freshly-killed birds will be fat and fresh-colored; if
it is dark and discolored, the game has been hung a long time. The
wings of good ducks, geese, pheasants and woodcock are tender to
the touch; the tips of the long wing feathers of partridges are
pointed in young birds and round in old ones. Quail, snipe and
small birds should have full, tender breasts. Poultry should never
be cooked until six or eight hours after it has been killed, but it
should be picked and drawn as soon as possible. Plunge it in a pot
of scalding hot water; then pluck off the feathers, taking care not
to tear the skin; when it is picked clean, roll up a piece of white
paper, set fire to it and singe off all the hairs. The <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 82]</span><a name='Page_82' id="Page_82"></a>head,
neck and feet should be cut off, and the ends of the legs skewered
to the body, and a string tied tightly around the body. When
roasting a chicken or small fowl there is danger of the legs
browning or becoming too hard to be eaten. To avoid this, take
strips of cloth, dip them into a little melted lard, or even just
rub them over with lard, and wind them around the legs. Remove them
in time to allow the legs to brown delicately.</p>
<p>Fowls, and also various kinds of game, when bought at our city
markets, require a more thorough cleansing than those sold in
country places, where as a general thing the meat is wholly
dressed. In large cities they lay for some length of time with the
intestines undrawn, until the flavor of them diffuses itself all
through the meat, rendering it distasteful. In this case, it is
safe, after taking out the intestines, to rinse out in several
waters, and in next to the last water, add a teaspoonful of baking
soda, say to a quart of water. This process neutralizes all
sourness, and helps to destroy all unpleasant taste in the
meat.</p>
<p>Poultry may be baked so that its wings and legs are soft and
tender, by being placed in a deep roasting pan with close cover,
thereby retaining the aroma and essences by absorption while
confined. These pans are a recent innovation, and are made double
with a small opening in the top for giving vent to the accumulation
of steam and gases when required. Roast meats of any kind can also
be cooked in the same manner, and it is a great improvement on the
old plan.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST TURKEY.</b></p>
<p>Select a young turkey; remove all the feathers carefully, singe
it over a burning newspaper on the top of the stove; then "draw" it
nicely, being very careful not to break any of the internal organs;
remove the crop carefully; cut off the head, and tie the neck close
to the body by drawing the skin over it. Now rinse the inside of
the turkey out with several waters, and in the next to the last,
mix a teaspoonful of baking soda; oftentimes the inside of a fowl
is very sour, especially if it is not freshly killed. Soda, being
cleansing, acts as a corrective, and destroys that unpleasant taste
which we frequently experience in the dressing when fowls have been
killed for some time. Now, after washing, wipe the turkey dry,
inside and out, with a clean cloth, rub the inside with some salt,
then stuff the breast and body <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
83]</span><a name='Page_83' id="Page_83"></a>with "Dressing for
Fowls." Then sew up the turkey with a strong thread, tie the legs
and wings to the body, rub it over with a little soft butter,
sprinkle over some salt and pepper, dredge with a little flour;
place it in a dripping-pan, pour in a cup of boiling water, and set
in the oven. Baste the turkey often, turning it around occasionally
so that every part will be uniformly baked. When pierced with a
fork and the liquid runs out perfectly clear, the bird is done. If
any part is likely to scorch, pin over it a piece of buttered white
paper. A fifteen pound turkey requires between three and four hours
to bake. Serve with cranberry sauce.</p>
<p><i>Gravy for Turkey.</i>&mdash;When you put the turkey in to
roast, put the neck, heart, liver and gizzard into a stewpan with a
pint of water; boil until they become quite tender; take them out
of the water, chop the heart and gizzard, mash the liver and throw
away the neck; return the chopped heart, gizzard and liver to the
liquor in which they were stewed; set it to one side, and when the
turkey is done it should be added to the gravy that dripped from
the turkey, having first skimmed off the fat from the surface of
the dripping-pan; set it all over the fire, boil three minutes and
thicken with flour. It will not need brown flour to color the
gravy. The garnishes for turkey or chicken are fried oysters, thin
slices of ham, slices of lemon, fried sausages, or force meat
balls, also parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRESSING OR STUFFING FOR FOWLS.</b></p>
<p>For an eight or ten pound turkey, cut the brown crust from
slices or pieces of stale bread until you have as much as the
inside of a pound loaf; put it into a suitable dish and pour tepid
water (not warm, for that makes it heavy) over it; let it stand one
minute, as it soaks very quickly. Now take up a handful at a time
and squeeze it hard and dry with both hands, placing it, as you go
along, in another dish; this process makes it very light. When all
is pressed dry, toss it all up lightly through your fingers; now
add pepper, salt&mdash;about a teaspoonful&mdash;also a teaspoonful
of powdered summer savory, the same amount of sage, or the green
herb minced fine; add half a cup of melted butter, and a beaten
egg, or not. Work thoroughly all together, and it is ready for
dressing either fowls, fish or meats. A little chopped sausage in
turkey dressing is considered by some an improvement, when well
incorporated with the other ingredients. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
84]</span><a name='Page_84' id="Page_84"></a>For geese and ducks
the stuffing may be made the same as for turkey, with the addition
of a few slices of onion chopped fine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER DRESSING OR STUFFING.</b></p>
<p>This is made with the same ingredients as the above, with the
exception of half a can of oysters drained and slightly chopped and
added to the rest. This is used mostly with boiled turkey and
chicken, and the remainder of the can of oysters used to make an
oyster sauce to be poured over the turkey when served; served
generally in a separate dish, to be dipped out as a person
desires.</p>
<p>These recipes were obtained from an old colored cook, who was
famous for his fine dressing for fowls, fish and meats, and his
advice was, <i>always</i> soak stale bread in <i>cold</i> liquid,
either milk or water, when <i>used</i> for stuffings or for
puddings, as they were much lighter. Hot liquid makes them
heavy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED TURKEY.</b></p>
<p>Prepare as you would for baking or roasting; fill with an oyster
stuffing, made as the above. Tie the legs and wings close to the
body, place in salted boiling water with the breast downward; skim
it often and boil about two hours, but not till the skin breaks.
Serve with oyster or celery sauce. Boil a nicely pickled piece of
salt pork, and serve at table a thin slice to each plate. Some
prefer bacon or ham instead of pork.</p>
<p>Some roll the turkey in a cloth dipped in flour. If the liquor
is to be used afterwards for soup, the cloth imparts an unpleasant
flavor. The liquor can be saved and made into a nice soup for the
next day's dinner, by adding the same seasoning as for chicken
soup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TURKEY SCALLOP.</b></p>
<p>Pick the meat from the bones of cold turkey and chop it fine.
Put a layer of bread crumbs on the bottom of a buttered dish,
moisten them with a little milk, then put in a layer of turkey with
some of the filling, and cut small pieces of butter over the top;
sprinkle with pepper and salt; then another layer of bread crumbs,
and so on until the dish is nearly full; add a little hot water to
the gravy left from the turkey and pour over it; then take two
eggs, two tablespoonfuls of milk, one of melted butter, a little
salt and cracker <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]</span><a name=
'Page_85' id="Page_85"></a>crumbs as much as will make it thick
enough to spread on with a knife; put bits of butter over it, and
cover with a plate. Bake three-quarters of an hour. Ten minutes
before serving, remove the plate and let it brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TURKEY HASHED.</b></p>
<p>Cut the remnants of turkey from a previous dinner into pieces of
equal size. Boil the bones in a quart of water, until the quart is
reduced to a pint; then take out the bones, and to the liquor in
which they were boiled add turkey gravy, if you have any, or white
stock, or a small piece of butter with salt and pepper; let the
liquor thus prepared boil up once; then put in the pieces of
turkey, dredge in a little flour, give it one boil-up, and serve in
a hot dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TURKEY WARMED OVER.</b></p>
<p>Pieces of cold turkey or chicken may be warmed up with a little
butter in a frying pan; place it on a warm platter, surround it
with pieces of small thick slices of bread or biscuit halved, first
dipping them in hot salted water; then place the platter in a warm
oven with the door open. Have already made the following gravy to
pour over all:&mdash;</p>
<p>Into the frying pan put a large spoonful of butter, one or two
cupfuls of milk, and any gravy that may be left over. Bring it to a
boil; then add sufficient flour, wet in a little cold milk or
water, to make it the consistency of cream. Season with salt,
pepper and add a little of the dark meat chopped <i>very</i> fine.
Let the sauce cook a few moments, then pour over the biscuit and
fowl. This will be found a really nice dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BONED TURKEY.</b></p>
<p>Clean the fowl as usual. With a sharp and pointed knife, begin
at the extremity of the wing, and pass the knife down close to the
bone, cutting all the flesh from the bone, and preserving the skin
whole; run the knife down each side of the breast bone and up the
legs, keeping close to the bone; then split the back half way up,
and draw out the bones; fill the places whence the bones were taken
with a stuffing, restoring the fowl to its natural form, and sew up
all the incisions made in the skin. Lard with two or three rows of
slips of fat bacon on the top, basting often with salt and water,
and a little butter. Some like a glass of port wine in the
gravy.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span><a name='Page_86' id=
"Page_86"></a>
<p>This is a difficult dish to attempt by any but skillful hands.
Carve across in slices, and serve with tomato sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST GOOSE.</b></p>
<p>The goose should not be more than eight months old, and the
fatter the more tender and juicy the meat. Stuff with the following
mixture: Three pints of bread crumbs, six ounces of butter, or part
butter and part salt pork, one teaspoonful each of sage, black
pepper and salt, one chopped onion. Do not stuff very full, and
stitch openings firmly together to keep flavor in and fat out.
Place in a baking pan with a little water, and baste frequently
with salt and water (some add vinegar); turn often so that the
sides and back may be nicely browned. Bake two hours or more; when
done take from the pan, pour off the fat, and to the brown gravy
left add the chopped giblets which have previously been stewed
until tender, together with the water they were boiled in; thicken
with a little flour and butter rubbed together, bring to a boil and
serve, English style.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Pick and draw them, wash out well in two or three waters, adding
a little soda to the last but one to sweeten it, if there is doubt
as to its being fresh. Dry it well with a clean cloth, and fill the
crop and body with a stuffing the same as "Dressing for Fowls." Lay
it in a dripping-pan; put a pint of hot water and a piece of butter
in the dripping-pan, add to it a small tablespoonful of salt, and a
small teaspoonful of pepper; baste frequently, and let it roast
quickly, without scorching; when nearly done, put a piece of butter
the size of a large egg to the water in the pan; when it melts,
baste with it, dredge a little flour over, baste again, and let it
finish; half an hour will roast a full grown chicken, if the fire
is right. When done, take it up.</p>
<p>Having stewed the necks, gizzards, livers and hearts in a very
little water, strain it and mix it hot with the gravy that has
dripped from the fowls, and which must be first skimmed. Thicken it
with a little browned flour, add to it the livers, hearts and
gizzards chopped small. Or, put the giblets in the pan with the
chicken and let them roast. Send the fowls to the table with the
gravy in a boat. Cranberry sauce should accompany them, or any tart
sauce.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]</span><a name='Page_87' id=
"Page_87"></a>
<p><b>BOILED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Clean, wash and stuff, as for roasting. Baste a floured cloth
around each and put into a pot with enough boiling water to cover
them well. The hot water cooks the skin at once and prevents the
escape of the juice. The broth will not be so rich as if the fowls
are put on in cold water, but this is a proof that the meat will be
more nutritious and better flavored. Stew very slowly, for the
first half hour especially. Boil an hour or more, guiding yourself
by size and toughness. Serve with egg, bread or oyster sauce. (See
SAUCES.)</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Rub the chicken on the inside with pepper and half a teaspoonful
of salt; place in a steamer in a kettle that will keep it as near
the water as possible, cover and steam an hour and a half; when
done, keep hot while dressing is prepared, then cut up, arrange on
the platter, and serve with the dressing over it.</p>
<p>The dressing is made as follows: Boil one pint of gravy from the
kettle without the fat, add cayenne pepper and half a teaspoonful
of salt; stir a tablespoonful of flour into a quarter of a pint of
cream until smooth and add to the gravy. Cornstarch may be used
instead of the flour, and some cooks add nutmeg or celery salt.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRICASSEE CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Cut up two young chickens, put them in a stewpan with just
enough cold water to cover them. Cover closely and let them heat
very slowly; then stew them over an hour, or until tender. If they
are old chickens they will require long, slow boiling, often from
three to four hours. When tender, season with salt and pepper, a
piece of butter as large as an egg, and a little celery, if liked.
Stir up two tablespoonfuls of flour in a little water or milk and
add to the stew, also two well-beaten yolks of eggs; let all boil
up one minute; arrange the chicken on a warm platter, pour some of
the gravy over it and send the rest to the table in a boat. The egg
should be added to a little of the cooled gravy before putting with
the hot gravy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED WHOLE SPRING CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Dress a full-grown spring chicken the same as for roasting,
seasoning it with salt and pepper inside and out; then fill the
body with <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]</span><a name='Page_88' id=
"Page_88"></a>oysters; place it in a tin pail with a close-fitting
cover. Set the pail in a pot of fast-boiling water and cook until
the chicken is tender. Dish up the chicken on a warm dish, then
pour the gravy into a saucepan, put into it a tablespoonful of
butter, half a cupful of cream or rich milk, three hard-boiled eggs
chopped fine, some minced herbs and a tablespoonful of flour. Let
all boil up and then pour it over the chicken. Serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Boil four chickens till tender enough for meat to fall from
bones; put meat in a stone jar and pour over it three pints of
cold, good cider vinegar and a pint and a half of the water in
which the chickens were boiled; add spices if preferred, and it
will be ready for use in two days. This is a popular Sunday evening
dish; it is good for luncheon at any time.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RISSOLES OF CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Mince up finely the remains of a cold chicken together with half
the quantity of lean, cold ham. Mix them well, adding enough white
sauce to moisten them. Now have light paste rolled out until about
a quarter of an inch or a little more in thickness. Cut the paste
into pieces, one inch by two in size, and lay a little of the
mixture upon the centres of half of the pieces and cover them with
the other halves, pressing the edges neatly together and forming
them into little rolls. Have your frying pan ready with plenty of
boiling hot lard, or other frying medium, and fry until they become
a golden-brown color. A minute or two will be sufficient for this.
Then drain them well and serve immediately on a napkin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN PATTIES.</b></p>
<p>Mince up fine cold chicken, either roasted or boiled. Season it
with pepper and salt, and a little minced parsley and onion.
Moisten it with chicken gravy or cream sauce, fill scalloped shells
that are lined with pastry with the mixture, and sprinkle bread
crumbs over the tops. Put two or three tiny pieces of butter over
each, and bake brown in a hot oven.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 89]</span><a name='Page_89' id=

<p><b>TO BROIL CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>After dressing and washing the chickens as previously directed,
split them open through the backbone; frog them by cutting the
cords under the wings and laying the wings out flat; cut the sinews
under the second joint of the leg and turn the leg down; press down
the breast-bone without breaking it.</p>
<p>Season the chicken with salt and pepper, lay it upon the
gridiron with the inside first to the fire; put the gridiron over a
slow fire, and place a tin sheet and weight upon the chicken, to
keep it flat; let it broil ten minutes, then turn and proceed in
the same manner with the other side.</p>
<p>The chicken should be perfectly cooked, but not scorched. A
broiled chicken brought to the table with its wings and legs burnt,
and its breast half cooked, is very disagreeable. To avoid this,
the chicken must be closely watched while broiling, and the fire
must be arranged so that the heat shall be equally dispensed. When
the fire is too hot under any one part of the chicken, put a little
ashes on the fire under that part, that the heat may be
reduced.</p>
<p>Dish a broiled chicken on a hot plate, putting a large lump of
butter and a tablespoonful of hot water upon the plate, and turning
the chicken two or three times that it may absorb as much of the
butter as possible. Garnish with parsley. Serve with poached eggs
on a separate dish. It takes from thirty to forty minutes to broil
a chicken well.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN PIE.</b></p>
<p>Prepare the chicken as for fricassee. When the chicken is stewed
tender, seasoned, and the gravy thickened, take it from the fire;
take out the largest bones, scrape the meat from the neck and
backbone, throw the bones away; line the sides of a four or six
quart pudding-dish with a rich baking powder or soda biscuit dough,
a quarter of an inch thick; put in part of the chicken, a few lumps
of butter, pepper and salt, if needed, some cold boiled eggs cut in
slices. Add the rest of the chicken and season as before; a few new
potatoes in their season might be added. Pour over the gravy, being
sure to have enough to fill the dish, and cover with a crust a
quarter of an inch thick, made with a hole in the centre the size
of a teacup.</p>
<p>Brush over the top with beaten white of egg and bake for half to
three-quarters of an hour. Garnish the top with small bright celery
leaves, neatly arranged in a circle.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]</span><a name='Page_90' id=

<p><b>FRIED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Wash and cut up a young chicken, wipe it dry, season with salt
and pepper, dredge it with flour, or dip each piece in beaten egg
and then in cracker crumbs. Have in a frying pan one ounce each of
butter and sweet lard made boiling hot. Lay in the chicken and fry
brown on both sides. Take up, drain it and set aside in a covered
dish. Stir into the gravy left, if not too much, a large
tablespoonful of flour, make it smooth, add a cup of cream or milk,
season with salt and pepper, boil up and pour over the chicken.
Some like chopped parsley added to the gravy. Serve hot.</p>
<p>If the chicken is old, put into a stewpan with a little water
and simmer gently till tender; season with salt and pepper, dip in
flour or cracker crumb and egg, and fry as above. Use the broth the
chicken was cooked in to make the gravy, instead of the cream or
milk, or use an equal quantity of both.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED CHICKEN &Aacute; LA ITALIENNE.</b></p>
<p>Make common batter; mix into it a cupful of chopped tomatoes,
one onion chopped, some minced parsley, salt and pepper. Cut up
young, tender chickens, dry them well and dip each piece in the
batter; then fry brown in plenty of butter in a thick-bottomed
frying pan. Serve with tomato sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN CROQUETTES. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Put a cup of cream or milk in a saucepan, set it over the fire,
and when it boils add a lump of butter as large as an egg, in which
has been mixed a tablespoonful of flour. Let it boil up thick;
remove from the fire, and when cool mix into it a teaspoonful of
salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, a bit of minced onion or
parsley, one cup of fine bread crumbs, and a pint of finely-chopped
cooked chicken, either roasted or boiled. Lastly, beat up two eggs
and work in with the whole. Flour your hands and make into small,
round, flat cakes; dip in egg and bread crumbs and fry like fish
cakes in butter and good sweet lard mixed, or like fried cakes in
plenty of hot lard. Take them up with a skimmer and lay them on
brown paper to free them from the grease. Serve hot.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]</span><a name='Page_91' id=
"Page_91"></a>
<p><b>CHICKEN CROQUETTES. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Take any kind of fresh meat or fowl, chop very fine, add an
equal quantity of smoothly mashed potatoes, mix, and season with
butter, salt, black pepper, a little prepared mustard, and a little
cayenne pepper; make into cakes, dip in egg and bread crumbs and
fry a light brown. A nice relish for tea.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO FRY CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>Beat up two eggs in a deep bowl; roll enough crackers until you
have a cupful of crumbs, or the same of fine stale bread crumbs;
spread the crumbs on a large plate or pie-tin. Have over the fire a
kettle containing two or three inches of boiling lard. As fast as
the croquettes are formed, roll them in the crumbs, then dip them
in the beaten egg, then again roll them in crumbs; drop them in the
smoking hot fat and fry them a light golden brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESSED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Clean and cut up your chickens. Stew in just enough water to
cover them. When nearly cooked, season them well with salt and
pepper. Let them stew down until the water is nearly all boiled
out, and the meat drops easily from the bones. Remove the bones and
gristle; chop the meat rather coarsely, then turn it back into the
stew-kettle, where the broth was left (after skimming off all fat),
and let it heat through again. Turn it into a square bread pan,
placing a platter on the top, and a heavy weight on the platter.
This, if properly prepared, will turn out like a mold of jelly and
may be sliced in smooth, even slices. The success of this depends
upon not having too much water; it will not jelly if too weak, or
if the water is allowed to boil away entirely while cooking. A good
way to cook old fowls.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN LUNCH FOR TRAVELING.</b></p>
<p>Cut a young chicken down the back; wash and wipe dry; season
with salt and pepper; put in a dripping-pan and bake in a moderate
oven three-quarters of an hour. This is much better for traveling
lunch than when seasoned with butter.</p>
<p>All kinds of poultry and meat can be cooked quicker by adding to
the water in which they are boiled a little vinegar or a piece of
lemon. By the use of a little acid there will be a considerable
saving of fuel, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]</span><a name=
'Page_92' id="Page_92"></a>as well as shortening of time. Its
action is beneficial on old tough meats, rendering them quite
tender and easy of digestion. Tainted meats and fowls will lose
their bad taste and odor if cooked in this way, and if not used too
freely no taste of it will be acquired.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTTED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Strip the meat from the bones of a cold roast fowl; to every
pound of meat allow a quarter of a pound of butter, salt and
cayenne pepper to taste; one teaspoonful of pounded mace, half a
small nutmeg. Cut the meat into small pieces, pound it well with
the butter, sprinkle in the spices gradually and keep pounding
until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste. Pack it into small jars
and cover with clarified butter, about a quarter of an inch in
thickness. Two or three slices of ham minced and pounded with the
above will be an improvement. Keep in a dry place. A luncheon or
breakfast dish.</p>
<p>Old fowls can be made very tender by putting into them, while
boiling, a piece of soda as large as a bean.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Divide a fowl into joints and boil till the meat leaves the bone
readily. Take out the bones and chop the meat as small as dice.
Thicken the water in which the fowl was boiled with flour and
season to taste with butter and salt. Fill a deep dish with
alternate layers of bread crumbs and chicken and slices of cooked
potatoes, having crumbs on top. Pour the gravy over the top and add
a few bits of butter and bake till nicely browned. There should be
gravy enough to moisten the dish. Serve with a garnish of parsley.
Tiny new potatoes are nice in place of sliced ones when in
season.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREADED CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Prepare young chickens as for fricassee by cutting them into
pieces. Dip each piece in beaten egg, then in grated bread crumbs
or rolled cracker; season them with pepper and salt and a little
minced parsley. Place them in a baking pan and put on the top of
each piece a lump of butter, add half of a cupful of hot water;
bake slowly, basting often. When sufficiently cooked take up on a
warm platter. Into the pan pour a cup of cream or rich milk, a
cupful of bread crumbs. Stir it well until cooked, then pour it
over the chicken. Serve while hot.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]</span><a name='Page_93' id=
"Page_93"></a>
<p><b>BROILED CHICKEN ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Broil the usual way and when thoroughly done take it up in a
square tin or dripping-pan, butter it well, season with pepper and
salt and set it in the oven for a few minutes. Lay slices of
moistened buttered toast on a platter; take the chicken up over it,
add to the gravy in the pan part of a cupful of cream, if you have
it; if not, use milk. Thicken with a little flour and pour over the
chicken.</p>
<p>This is considered most excellent.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRY CHICKEN.</b></p>
<p>Cut up a chicken weighing from a pound and a half to two pounds,
as for fricassee, wash it well, and put it into a stewpan with
sufficient water to cover it; boil it, closely covered, until
tender; add a large teaspoonful of salt, and cook a few minutes
longer; then remove from the fire, take out the chicken, pour the
liquor into a bowl, and set it one side. Now cut up into the
stewpan two small onions, and fry them with a piece of butter as
large as an egg; as soon as the onions are brown, skim them out and
put in the chicken; fry for three or four minutes; next sprinkle
over two teaspoonfuls of Curry Powder. Now pour over the liquor in
which the chicken was stewed, stir all well together, and stew for
five minutes longer, then stir into this a tablespoonful of sifted
flour made thin with a little water; lastly, stir in a beaten yolk
of egg, and it is done.</p>
<p>Serve with hot boiled rice laid around on the edge of a platter,
and the chicken curry in the centre.</p>
<p>This makes a handsome side dish, and a fine relish accompanying
a full dinner of roast beef or any roast.</p>
<p>All first-class grocers and druggists keep this "India Curry
Powder," put up in bottles. Beef, veal, mutton, duck, pigeons,
partridges, rabbits or fresh fish may be substituted for the
chicken, if preferred, and sent to the table with or without a dish
of rice.</p>
<p><i>To Boil Rice or Curry.</i>&mdash;Pick over the rice, a
cupful. Wash it thoroughly in two or three cold waters; then leave
it about twenty minutes in cold water. Put into a stewpan two
quarts of water with a teaspoonful of salt in it; and when it
boils, sprinkle in the rice. Boil it briskly for twenty minutes,
keeping the pan covered. Take it from the fire, and drain off the
water. Afterwards set the saucepan <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
94]</span><a name='Page_94' id="Page_94"></a>on the back of the
stove, with the lid off, to allow the rice to dry and the grains to
separate.</p>
<p>Rice, if properly boiled, should be soft and white, and every
grain stand alone. Serve it hot in a separate dish or served as
above, laid around the chicken curry.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN POT-PIE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Cut and joint a large chicken, cover with cold water, and let it
boil gently until tender. Season with salt and pepper, and thicken
the gravy with two tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed smooth with a
piece of butter the size of an egg. Have ready nice light
bread-dough, cut with the top of a wine-glass about a half an inch
thick; let them stand half an hour and rise, then drop these into
the boiling gravy. Put the cover on the pot closely, wrap a cloth
around it, in order that no steam shall escape; and by no means
allow the pot to cease boiling. Boil three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN POT-PIE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>This style of pot-pie was made more in our grandmother's day
than now, as most cooks consider that cooking crust so long
destroys its spongy lightness, and renders it too hard and dry.</p>
<p>Take a pair of fine fowls, cut them up, wash the pieces, and
season with pepper only. Make a light biscuit dough, and plenty of
it, as it is always much liked by the eaters of pot-pie. Roll out
the dough not very thin, and cut most of it into long squares.
Butter the sides of a pot, and line them with dough nearly to the
top. Lay slices of cold ham at the bottom of the pot, and then the
pieces of fowl, interspersed all through with squares of dough and
potatoes, pared and quartered. Pour in a quart of water. Cover the
whole with a lid of dough, having a slit in the centre, through
which the gravy will bubble up. Boil it steadily for two hours.
Half an hour before you take it up, put in through the hole in the
centre of the crust some bits of butter rolled in flour, to thicken
the gravy. When done, put the pie on a large dish, and pour the
gravy over it.</p>
<p>You may intersperse it all through with cold ham.</p>
<p>A pot-pie may be made of ducks, rabbits, squirrels or venison.
Also of beefsteak. A beefsteak, or some porksteaks (the lean only),
greatly improve a chicken pot-pie. If you use no ham, season with
salt.</p>

<p><b>CHICKEN STEWED WITH BISCUIT.</b></p>
<p>Take chickens, and make a fricassee; just before you are ready
to dish it up, have ready two baking-tins of rich soda or
baking-powder biscuits; take them from the oven hot, split them
apart by breaking them with your hands, lay them on a large meat
platter, covering it, then pour the hot chicken stew over all. Send
to the table hot. This is a much better way than boiling this kind
of biscuit in the stew, as you are more sure of its being always
light.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN DRESSED AS TERRAPIN.</b></p>
<p>Select young chickens, clean and cut them into pieces; put them
into a stewpan with just <i>enough</i> water to cook them. When
tender stir into it half of a cup of butter and one beaten egg.
Season it with salt and pepper, a teaspoonful of powdered thyme;
add two hard-boiled eggs coarsely minced and a small glass of wine.
Boil up once and serve with jelly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN ROLY-POLY.</b></p>
<p>One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar mixed with
the flour, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a teacupful of
milk; a teaspoonful of salt; do not use shortening of any kind, but
roll out the mixture half an inch thick, and on it lay minced
chicken, veal or mutton. The meat must be seasoned with pepper and
salt and be free from gristle. Roll the crust over and over, and
put it on a buttered plate and place in a steamer for half an hour.
Serve for breakfast or lunch, giving a slice to each person with
gravy served with it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN TURNOVERS.</b></p>
<p>Chop cold roast chicken very fine. Put it into a saucepan, place
it over the fire, moisten it with a little water and gravy, or a
piece of butter. Season with salt and pepper; add a small
tablespoonful of sifted flour dissolved in a little water; heat all
through and remove from the fire to become cool. When cooled roll
out some plain pie-crust quite thin, cut out in rounds as large as
a saucer; wet the edge with cold water and put a large spoonful of
the minced meat on one-half of the round; fold the other half over
and pinch the edges well together, then fry them in hot drippings
or fat a nice brown. They may also be cooked in a moderate
oven.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]</span><a name='Page_96' id=

<p><b>CHICKEN PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Cut up two young chickens into good-sized pieces; put them in a
saucepan with just enough water to cover them well. When boiled
quite tender, season with salt and pepper; let them simmer ten or
fifteen minutes longer; then take the chicken from the broth and
remove all the large bones. Place the meat in a well-buttered
pudding dish, season again, if necessary, adding a few bits of
butter. Pour over this the following batter:&mdash;</p>
<p>Eight eggs beaten light and mixed with one quart of milk, three
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt and two
large teaspoonfuls of baking powder, added to enough sifted flour
to make a batter like griddle-cakes.</p>
<p>Bake one hour in a <i>moderate</i> oven.</p>
<p>Make a gravy of the broth that remained from the cooking of the
chicken, adding a tablespoonful of flour stirred into a third of a
cup of melted butter; let it boil up, putting in more water if
necessary. Serve hot in a gravy boat with the pudding.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN AND MACARONI.</b></p>
<p>Boil a chicken until very tender, take out all the bones, and
pick up the meat quite fine. Boil half a pound of macaroni until
tender, first breaking it up to pieces an inch long. Butter a deep
pudding dish, put on the bottom a layer of the cooked macaroni,
then a layer of the minced chicken, bits of butter, pepper and
salt, then some of the chicken liquor, over this put another layer
of macaroni, and so on, until, the dish is filled. Pour a cup of
cream over the whole, and bake half an hour. Serve on a
platter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST DUCK. (Tame.)</b></p>
<p>Pick, draw, clean thoroughly, and wipe dry. Cut the neck close
to the back, beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling pin, tie the
wings and legs securely, and stuff with the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Three pints bread crumbs, six ounces butter, or part butter and
salt pork, two chopped onions and one teaspoonful each of sage,
black pepper and salt. Do not stuff very full, and sew up the
openings firmly to keep the flavor in and the fat out. If not fat
enough, it should be larded with salt pork, or tie a slice upon the
breast. Place in a baking pan, with a little water, and baste
frequently with salt and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
97]</span><a name='Page_97' id="Page_97"></a>water&mdash;some add
onion, and some vinegar; turn often, so that the sides and back may
all be nicely browned. When nearly done, baste with butter and a
little flour. These directions will apply to tame geese as well as
ducks. Young ducks should roast from twenty-five to thirty minutes,
and full-grown ones for an hour or more, with frequent basting.
Some prefer them underdone and served very hot; but, as a rule,
thorough cooking will prove more palatable. Make a gravy out of the
necks and gizzards by putting them in a quart of cold water, that
must be reduced to a pint by boiling. The giblets, when done, may
be chopped fine and added to the juice. The preferred seasonings
are one tablespoonful of Madeira or sherry, a blade of mace, one
small onion, and a little cayenne pepper; strain through a hair
sieve; pour a little over the ducks and serve the remainder in a
boat. Served with jellies or any tart sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BRAISED DUCK.</b></p>
<p>Prepare a pair of fine young ducks, the same as for roasting,
place them in a stewpan together with two or three slices of bacon,
a carrot, an onion stuck with two cloves, and a little thyme and
parsley. Season with pepper, and cover the whole with a broth,
adding to the broth a gill of white wine. Place the pan over a
gentle fire and allow the ducks to simmer until done, basting them
frequently. When done remove them from the pan, and place them
where they will keep hot. A turnip should then be cut up and fried
in some butter. When nicely browned, drain the pieces and cook them
until tender in the liquor in which the ducks were braised. Now
strain and thicken the gravy, and after dishing up the ducks, pour
it over them, garnishing with the pieces of turnip.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Palmer House, Chicago.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED DUCK.</b></p>
<p>Prepare them by cutting them up the same as chicken for
fricassee. Lay two or three very thin slices of salt pork upon the
bottom of a stewpan; lay the pieces of duck upon the pork. Let them
stew slowly for an hour, closely covered. Then season with salt and
pepper, half a teaspoonful of powdered sage, or some green sage
minced fine; one chopped onion. Stew another half hour until the
duck is tender. Stir up a large tablespoonful of brown flour in a
little water and add it to the stew. Let it boil up, and serve all
together in one dish, accompanied with green peas.</p>

<p><b>DUCK PIE.</b></p>
<p>Cut all the meat from cold roast ducks; put the bones and
stuffing into cold water; cover them and let boil; put the meat
into a deep dish; pour on enough of the stock made from the bones
to moisten; cover with pastry slit in the centre with a knife, and
bake a light brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WARMED UP DUCK.</b></p>
<p>A nice dish for breakfast, and very relishing, can be made from
the remains of a roast of duck. Cut the meat from the bones, pick
out all the little tidbits in the recesses, lay them in a frying
pan, and cover with water and the cold gravy left from the roast;
add a piece of butter; let all boil up once and if not quite thick
enough, stir in a little dissolved flour. Serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST WILD DUCK.</b></p>
<p>Wild duck should not be dressed too soon after being killed. If
the weather is cold it will be better for being kept several days.
Bake in a hot oven, letting it remain for five or ten minutes
without basting to keep in the gravy, then baste frequently with
butter and water. If over-done it loses flavor, thirty to forty
minutes in the right kind of an oven being sufficient. Serve on a
very hot dish, and send to table as hot as possible with a cut
lemon and the following sauce:&mdash;</p>
<p>Put in a tiny saucepan a tablespoonful each of Worcestershire
sauce and mushroom catsup, a little salt and cayenne pepper and the
juice of half a lemon. Mix well, make it hot, remove from the fire
and stir in a teaspoonful of made mustard. Pour into a hot gravy
boat.</p>
<div class='right'><i>California Style, Lick House.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>WILD DUCKS.</b></p>
<p>Most wild ducks are apt to have the flavor of fish, and when in
the hands of inexperienced cooks are sometimes unpalatable on this
account. Before roasting them, parboil them with a small peeled
carrot put within each duck. This absorbs the unpleasant taste. An
onion will have the same effect, but unless you use onions in the
stuffing the carrot is preferable. Roast the same as tame duck. Or
put into the duck a whole onion peeled, plenty of salt and pepper
and a glass of claret, bake in a hot oven twenty minutes. Serve hot
with the gravy it yields in cooking and a dish of currant
jelly.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]</span><a name='Page_99' id=

<p><b>CANVAS-BACK DUCK.</b></p>
<p>The epicurean taste declares that this special kind of bird
requires no spices or flavors to make it perfect, as the meat
partakes of the flavor of the food that the bird feeds upon, being
mostly wild celery; and the delicious flavor is best preserved when
roasted quickly with a hot fire. After dressing the duck in the
usual way by plucking, singeing, drawing, wipe it with a wet towel,
truss the head under the wing; place it in a dripping-pan, put it
in the oven, basting often, and roast it half an hour. It is
generally preferred a little underdone. Place it when done on a hot
dish, season well with salt and pepper, pour over it the gravy it
has yielded in baking and serve it immediately while hot.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Delmonico.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST PIGEONS.</b></p>
<p>Pigeons lose their flavor by being kept more than a day after
they are killed. They may be prepared and roasted or broiled the
same as chickens; they will require from twenty to thirty minutes'
cooking. Make a gravy of the giblets or not, season it with pepper
and salt, and add a little flour and butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED PIGEONS.</b></p>
<p>Clean and stuff with onion dressing, thyme, etc.,&mdash;do not
sew up; take five or more slices of corned pork, let it fry a while
in a pot so that the fat comes out and it begins to brown a little;
then lay the pigeons all around in the fat, leaving the pork still
in; add hot water enough to partially cover them; cover tightly and
boil an hour or so until tender; then turn off some of the liquid,
and keep turning them so they will brown nicely; then heat and add
the liquor poured off; add extra thyme, pepper, and keep turning
until the pigeons and gravy are nicely browned. Thicken with a
little flour, and serve with the gravy poured over them; garnish
with parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PIGEON PIE.</b></p>
<p>Take half a dozen pigeons; stuff each one with a dressing the
same as for turkey; loosen the joints with a knife, but do not
separate them. Put them in a stewpan with water enough to cover
them, let them cook until nearly tender, then season them with salt
and pepper and butter. Thicken the gravy with flour, remove and
cool. Butter a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 100]</span><a name=
'Page_100' id="Page_100"></a>pudding dish, line the sides with a
rich crust. Have ready some hard-boiled eggs cut in slices. Put in
a layer of egg and birds and gravy until the dish is full. Cover
with a crust and bake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED PIGEONS OR SQUABS.</b></p>
<p>Split them down the back and broil the same as chicken;
seasoning well with salt, pepper and plenty of butter. Broil slices
of salt pork, very thin; place a slice over each bird and
serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SQUAB POT-PIE.</b></p>
<p>Cut into dice three ounces of salt pork; divide six wild squabs
into pieces at the joints; remove the skin. Cut up four potatoes
into small squares, and prepare a dozen small dough balls.</p>
<p>Put into a yellow, deep baking dish the pork, potatoes and
squabs, and then the balls of dough, season with salt, white
pepper, a dash of mace or nutmeg; add hot water enough to cover the
ingredients, cover with a "short" pie-crust and bake in a moderate
oven three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Palmer House, Chicago.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>WOODCOCK, ROASTED.</b></p>
<p>Skin the head and neck of the bird, pluck the feathers, and
truss it by bringing the beak of the bird under the wing, and
fastening the pinion to the thigh; twist the legs at the knuckles
and press the feet upon the thigh. Put a piece of bread under each
bird to catch the drippings, baste with butter, dredge with flour,
and roast fifteen or twenty minutes with a sharp fire. When done,
cut the bread in diamond shape, each piece large enough to stand
one bird upon, place them aslant on your dish, and serve with gravy
enough to moisten the bread; serve some in the dish and some in the
tureen; garnish with slices of lemon. Roast from twenty to
twenty-five minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SNIPE.</b></p>
<p>Snipe are similar to woodcock, and may be served in the same
manner; they will require less time to roast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>REED BIRDS.</b></p>
<p>Pick and draw them very carefully, salt and dredge with flour,
and roast with a quick fire ten or fifteen minutes. Serve on toast
with <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]</span><a name='Page_101' id=
"Page_101"></a>butter and pepper. You can put in each one an oyster
dipped in butter and then in bread crumbs before roasting. They are
also very nice broiled.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST QUAIL.</b></p>
<p>Rinse well and steam over boiling water until tender, then
dredge with flour, and smother in butter; season with salt and
pepper and roast inside the stove; thicken the gravy; serve with
green grape jelly, and garnish with parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO ROAST PARTRIDGES, PHEASANTS, QUAIL OR GROUSE.</b></p>
<p>Carefully cut out all the shot, wash thoroughly but quickly,
using soda in the water; rinse again, and dry with a clean cloth.
Stuff them and sew them up. Skewer the legs and wings to the body,
larder the breast with very thin slices of fat salt pork, place
them in the oven, and baste with butter and water before taking up,
having seasoned them with salt and pepper; or you can leave out the
pork and use only butter, or cook them without stuffing. Make a
gravy of the drippings thickened with browned flour. Boil up and
serve in a boat.</p>
<p>These are all very fine broiled, first splitting down the back,
placing on the gridiron the inside down, cover with a baking tin,
and broil slowly at first. Serve with cream gravy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GAME PIE.</b></p>
<p>Clean well, inside and out, a dozen small birds, quail, snipe,
woodcock, etc., and split them in half; put them in a saucepan with
about two quarts of water; when it boils, skim off all scum that
rises; then add salt and pepper, a bunch of minced parsley, one
onion chopped fine, and three whole cloves. Cut up half a pound of
salt pork into dice, and let all boil until tender, using care that
there be enough water to cover the birds. Thicken this with two
tablespoonfuls of browned flour and let it boil up. Stir in a piece
of butter as large as an egg; remove from the fire and let it cool.
Have ready a pint of potatoes cut as small as dice, and a rich
crust made. Line the sides of a buttered pudding dish with the
crust; lay in the birds, then some of the potatoes, then birds and
so on, until the dish is full. Pour over the gravy, put on the top
crust, with a slit cut in the centre, and bake. The top can be
ornamented with pastry leaves in a wreath about the edge, with any
fancy design placed in the centre across the slit.</p>

<p><b>SNOWBIRDS.</b></p>
<p>One dozen thoroughly cleaned birds; stuff each with an oyster,
put them into a yellow dish, and add two ounces of boiled salt pork
and three raw potatoes cut into slices; add a pint of oyster
liquor, an ounce of butter; salt and pepper; cover the dish with a
crust and bake in moderate oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SQUIRREL.</b></p>
<p>They are cooked similar to rabbits, are excellent when broiled
or made into a stew, and, in fact, are very good in all the
different styles of cooking similar to rabbit.</p>
<p>There are many species common to this country; among them the
black, red, gray and fox. Gophers and chipmunks may also be classed
as another but smaller variety.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST HARE OR RABBIT.</b></p>
<p>A very close relationship exists between the hare and the
rabbit, the chief difference being in the smaller size and shorter
legs and ears of the latter. The manner of dressing and preparing
each for the table is, therefore, pretty nearly the same. To
prepare them for roasting, first skin, wash well in cold water and
rinse thoroughly in lukewarm water. If a little musty from being
emptied before they were hung up, and afterward neglected, rub the
insides with vinegar and afterward remove all taint of the acid by
a thorough washing in lukewarm water. After being well wiped with a
soft cloth put in a dressing as usual, sew the animal up, truss it,
and roast for half or three-quarters of an hour, until well
browned, basting it constantly with butter and dredging with flour,
just before taking up.</p>
<p>To make a gravy, after the rabbits are roasted, pour nearly all
the fat out of the pan, but do not pour the bottom or brown part of
the drippings; put the pan over the fire, stir into it a heaping
tablespoonful of flour, and stir until the flour browns. Then stir
in a pint of boiling water. Season the gravy with salt and pepper;
let it boil for a moment. Send hot to the table in a tureen with
the hot rabbits. Serve with currant jelly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRICASSEE RABBIT.</b></p>
<p>Clean two young rabbits, cut into joints, and soak in salt and
water half an hour. Put into a saucepan with a pint of cold water,
a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 103]</span><a name='Page_103' id=
"Page_103"></a>bunch of sweet herbs, an onion finely minced, a
pinch of mace, half a nutmeg, a pinch of pepper and half a pound of
salt pork cut in small thin slices. Cover and stew until tender.
Take out the rabbits and set in a dish where they will keep warm.
Add to the gravy a cup of cream (or milk), two well-beaten eggs,
stirred in a little at a time, a tablespoonful of butter, and a
thickening made of a tablespoonful of flour and a little milk. Boil
up once; remove the saucepan from the fire, squeeze in the juice of
a lemon, stirring all the while, and pour over the rabbits. Do not
cook the head or neck.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED RABBIT.</b></p>
<p>After the rabbit has been thoroughly cleaned and washed, put it
into boiling water, and let it boil ten minutes; drain it, and when
cold, cut it into joints, dip into beaten egg, and then in fine
bread crumbs; season with salt and pepper. When all are ready, fry
them in butter and sweet lard, mix over a moderate fire until brown
on both sides. Take them out, thicken the gravy with a spoonful of
flour, turn in a cup of milk or cream; let all boil up, and turn
over the rabbits. Serve hot with onion sauce. (See SAUCES.) Garnish
with sliced lemon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RABBIT PIE.</b></p>
<p>This pie can be made the same as "Game Pie" excepting you
scatter through it four hard-boiled eggs cut in slices. Cover with
puff paste, cut a slit in the middle, and bake one hour, laying
paper over the top should it brown too fast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED RABBITS.</b></p>
<p>After skinning and cleaning the rabbits, wipe them dry, split
them down the back lengthwise, pound them flat, then wrap them in
letter paper well buttered, place them on a buttered gridiron, and
broil over a clear, brisk fire, turning them often. When
sufficiently cooked, remove the papers, lay them on a very hot
platter, season with salt, pepper and plenty of butter, turning
them over and over to soak up the butter. Cover and keep hot in a
warming oven until served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALMI OF GAME.</b></p>
<p>This is a nice mode of serving the remains of roasted game, but
when a superlative salmi is desired, the birds must be scarcely
more than half roasted for it. In either case, carve them very
neatly, and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]</span><a name='Page_104'
id="Page_104"></a>strip every particle of skin and fat from the
legs, wings and breasts; bruise the bodies well, and put them with
the skin and other trimmings into a very clean stewpan. If for a
simple and inexpensive dinner, merely add to them two sliced
onions, a bay-leaf, a small blade of mace and a few peppercorns;
then pour in a pint or more of good veal gravy, or strong broth,
and boil it briskly until reduced nearly half; strain the gravy,
pressing the bones well to obtain all the flavor; skim off the fat,
add a little cayenne and lemon juice, heat the game very gradually
in it, but do not on any account allow it to boil; place pieces of
fried bread around a dish, arrange the birds in good form in the
centre, give the sauce a boil, and pour it on them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON.</b></p>
<p>To prepare a haunch of venison for roasting, wash it slightly in
tepid water and dry it thoroughly by rubbing it with a clean, soft
cloth. Lay over the fat side a large sheet of thickly-buttered
paper, and next a paste of flour and water about three-quarters of
an inch thick; cover this again with two or three sheets of stout
paper, secure the whole well with twine, and put down to roast,
with a little water, in the dripping-pan. Let the fire be clear and
strong; baste the paper immediately with butter or clarified
drippings, and roast the joint from three to four hours, according
to its weight and quality. Doe venison will require half an hour
less time than buck venison. About twenty minutes before the joint
is done remove the paste and paper, baste the meat in every part
with butter, and dredge it very lightly with flour; let it take a
pale brown color, and serve hot with unflavored gravy made with a
thickening in a tureen and good currant jelly. Venison is much
better when the deer has been killed in the autumn, when wild
berries are plentiful, and it has had abundant opportunities to
fatten upon this and other fresh food.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Windsor Hotel, Montreal.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED VENISON STEAK.</b></p>
<p>Venison steaks should be broiled over a clear fire, turning
often. It requires more cooking than beef. When sufficiently done,
season with salt and pepper, pour over two tablespoonfuls of
currant jelly melted with a piece of butter. Serve hot on hot
plates.</p>
<p>Delicious steaks, corresponding to the shape of mutton chops,
are cut from the loin.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]</span><a name='Page_105' id=
"Page_105"></a>
<p><b>BAKED SADDLE OF VENISON.</b></p>
<p>Wash the saddle carefully; see that no hairs are left dried on
to the outside. Use a saddle of venison of about ten pounds. Cut
some salt pork in strips about two inches long and an eighth of an
inch thick, with which lard the saddle with two rows on each side.
In a large dripping-pan cut two carrots, one onion and some salt
pork in thin slices; add two bay-leaves, two cloves, four kernels
of allspice, half a lemon sliced, and season with salt and pepper;
place the saddle of venison in the pan, with a quart of good stock
boiling hot and a small piece of butter, and let it boil about
fifteen minutes on top of the stove; then put it in a hot oven and
bake, basting well every five minutes, until it is medium rare, so
that the blood runs when cut; serve with jelly or a wine sauce. If
the venison is desired well done, cook much longer, and use a cream
sauce with it, or stir cream into the venison gravy. (For cream
sauce see SAUCES.)</p>
<p>Venison should never be roasted unless very fat. The shoulder is
a roasting piece and may be done without the paper or paste.</p>
<p>In ordering the saddle request the butcher to cut the ribs off
pretty close, as the only part that is of much account is the
tenderloin and thick meat that lies along the backbone up to the
neck. The ribs which extend from this have very little meat on
them, but are always sold with the saddle. When neatly cut off they
leave the saddle in a better shape, and the ribs can be put into
your stock-pot to boil for soup.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Windsor Hotel, Montreal.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>VENISON PIE OR PASTRY.</b></p>
<p>The neck, breast and shoulder are the parts used for a venison
pie or pastry. Cut the meat into pieces (fat and lean together) and
put the bones and trimmings into the stewpan with pepper and salt,
and water or veal broth enough to cover it. Simmer it till you have
drawn out a good gravy. Then strain it.</p>
<p>In the meantime make a good rich paste, and roll it rather
thick. Cover the bottom and sides of a deep dish with one sheet of
it, and put in your meat, having seasoned it with pepper, salt,
nutmeg and mace. Pour in the gravy which you have prepared from the
trimmings, and a glass of port wine. Lay on the top some bits of
butter rolled in flour. Cover the pie with a thick lid of paste and
ornament it handsomely with leaves and flowers formed with a tin
cutter. Bake <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 106]</span><a name=
'Page_106' id="Page_106"></a>two or more hours according to the
size. Just before it is done, pull it forward in the oven, and
brush it over with beaten egg; push it back and let it slightly
brown.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Windsor Hotel, Montreal.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>VENISON HASHED.</b></p>
<p>Cut the meat in nice small slices, and put the trimmings and
bones into a saucepan with barely water enough to cover them. Let
them stew for an hour. Then strain the liquid into a stewpan; add
to it some bits of butter, rolled in flour, and whatever gravy was
left of the venison the day before. Stir in some currant jelly, and
give it a boil up. Then put in the meat, and keep it over the fire
just long enough to warm it through; but do not allow it to boil,
as it has been once cooked already.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED VENISON STEAK.</b></p>
<p>Cut a breast of venison into steaks; make a quarter of a pound
of butter hot in a pan; rub the steaks over with a mixture of a
little salt and pepper; dip them in wheat flour, or rolled
crackers, and fry a rich brown; when both sides are done, take them
up on a dish, and put a tin cover over; dredge a heaping
teaspoonful of flour into the butter in the pan, stir it with a
spoon until it is brown, without burning; put to it a small
teacupful of boiling water, with a tablespoonful of currant jelly
dissolved into it; stir it for a few minutes, then strain it over
the meat and serve. A glass of wine, with a tablespoonful of white
sugar dissolved in it, may be used for the gravy, instead of the
jelly and water. Venison may be boiled, and served with boiled
vegetables, pickled beets, etc., and sauce.</p>

<h2><b>MEATS.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>In the selection of meat it is most essential that we understand
how to choose it; in beef it should be a smooth, fine grain, of a
clear bright red color, the fat white, and will feel tender when
pinched with the fingers. Will also have abundant kidney fat or
suet. The most choice pieces for roast are the sirloin, fore and
middle ribs.</p>
<p>Veal, to be good, should have the flesh firm and dry, fine
grained and of a delicate pinkish color, and plenty of kidney fat;
the joints stiff.</p>
<p>Mutton is good when the flesh is a bright red, firm and juicy
and a close grain, the fat firm and white.</p>
<p>Pork, if young, the lean will break on being pinched smooth when
nipped with the fingers, also the skin will break and dent; if the
rind is rough and hard it is old.</p>
<p>In roasting meat, allow from fifteen to twenty minutes to the
pound, which will vary according to the thickness of the roast. A
great deal of the success in roasting depends on the heat and
goodness of the fire; if put into a cool oven it loses its juices,
and the result is a tough, tasteless roast; whereas, if the oven is
of the proper heat, it immediately sears up the pores of the meat
and the juices are retained.</p>
<p>The oven should be the hottest when the meat is put into it, in
order to quickly crisp the surface and close the pores of the meat,
thereby confining its natural juices. If the oven is too hot to
hold the hand in for only a moment, then it is right to receive the
meat. The roast should first be washed in pure water, then wiped
dry with a clean dry cloth, placed in a baking pan without any
seasoning; some pieces of suet or cold drippings laid under it, but
<i>no water</i> should be put into the pan, for this would have a
tendency to soften the outside of the meat. The water can never get
so hot as the hot fat upon the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
108]</span><a name='Page_108' id="Page_108"></a>surface of the
meat, and the generating of the steam prevents its crispness, so
desirable in a roast.</p>
<p>It should be frequently basted with its own drippings, which
flow from the meat when partly cooked, and well seasoned. Lamb,
veal and pork should be cooked rather slower than beef, with a more
<i>moderate</i> fire, covering the fat with a piece of paper, and
<i>thoroughly</i> cooked till the flesh parts from the bone, and
nicely browned, without being burned. An onion sliced and put on
top of a roast while cooking, especially roast of pork, gives a
nice flavor. Remove the onion before serving.</p>
<p>Larding meats is drawing ribbons of fat pork through the upper
surface of the meat, leaving both ends protruding. This is
accomplished by the use of a larding needle, which may be procured
at house-furnishing stores.</p>
<p>Boiling or stewing meat, if fresh, should be put into
<i>boiling</i> water, closely covered and boiled <i>slowly</i>,
allowing twenty minutes to each pound, and, when partly cooked, or
when it begins to get tender, salted, adding spices and
vegetables.</p>
<p>Salt meats should be covered with <i>cold</i> water, and require
thirty minutes <i>very slow</i> boiling, from the time the water
boils, for each pound; if it is very salt, pour off the first water
and put it in another of boiling water, or it may be soaked one
night in cold water. After meat commences to boil the pot should
<i>never stop</i> simmering and always be replenished from the
<i>boiling</i> tea-kettle.</p>
<p>Frying may be done in two ways. One method, which is most
generally used, is by putting one ounce or more (as the case
requires) of beef drippings, lard or butter into a frying pan, and
when at the <i>boiling point</i> lay in the meat, cooking both
sides a nice brown. The other method is to <i>completely
immerse</i> the article to be cooked in sufficient <i>hot</i> lard
to cover it, similar to frying doughnuts.</p>
<p>Broiled meats should be placed over clear, red coals free from
smoke, giving out a good heat, but not too brisk, or the meat will
be hardened and scorched; but if the fire is dead the gravy will
escape and drop upon the coals, creating a blaze, which will
blacken and smoke the meat. Steaks and chops should be turned
often, in order that every part should be evenly done&mdash;never
sticking a fork into the lean part, as that lets the juices escape;
it should be put into the outer skin or fat. When the meat is
sufficiently broiled it should be laid on <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
109]</span><a name='Page_109' id="Page_109"></a>a <i>hot</i> dish
and seasoned. The best pieces for steak are the porterhouse,
sirloin and rump.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THAWING FROZEN MEAT, ETC.</b></p>
<p>If meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, or any other article of
food, when found frozen, is thawed by putting it into <i>warm
water</i> or placing it before the fire, it will most certainly
spoil by that process, and be rendered unfit to eat. The only way
to thaw these things is by immersing them in <i>cold</i> water.
This should be done as soon as they are brought in from market,
that they may have time to be well thawed before they are cooked.
If meat that has been frozen is to be boiled, put it on in cold
water. If to be roasted, begin by setting it at a distance from the
fire, for if it should not chance to be thoroughly thawed all
through to the centre, placing it at first too near the fire will
cause it to spoil. If it is expedient to thaw the meat or poultry
the night before cooking, lay it in cold water early in the
evening, and change the water at bed-time. If found crusted with
ice in the morning, remove the ice, and put the meat in fresh cold
water, letting it lie in it till wanted for cooking.</p>
<p>Potatoes are injured by being frozen. Other vegetables are not
the worse for it, provided they are always thawed in cold
water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO KEEP MEAT FROM FLIES.</b></p>
<p>Put in sacks, with enough straw around it so the flies cannot
reach through. Three-fourths of a yard of yard-wide muslin is the
right size for the sack. Put a little straw in the bottom, then put
in the ham and lay straw in all around it; tie it tightly and hang
it in a cool, dry place. Be sure the straw is all around the meat,
so the flies cannot reach through to deposit the eggs. (The sacking
must be done early in the season before the fly appears.) Muslin
lets the air in and is much better than paper. Thin muslin is as
good as thick, and will last for years if washed when laid away
when emptied.</p>
<div class='right'><i>National Stockman.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST BEEF.</b></p>
<p>One very essential point in roasting beef is to have the oven
well heated when the beef is first put in; this causes the pores to
close up quickly, and prevents the escape of the juices.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]</span><a name='Page_110' id=
"Page_110"></a>
<p>Take a rib piece or loin roast of seven or eight pounds. Wipe it
thoroughly all over with a clean wet towel. Lay it in a
dripping-pan, and baste it well with butter or suet fat. Set it in
the oven. Baste it frequently with its own drippings, which will
make it brown and tender. When partly done season with salt and
pepper, as it hardens any meat to salt it when raw, and draws out
its juices, then dredge with sifted flour to give it a frothy
appearance. It will take a roast of this size about two hours' time
to be properly done, leaving the inside a little rare or
red&mdash;half an hour less would make the inside quite rare.
Remove the beef to a heated dish, set where it will keep hot; then
skim the drippings from all fat, add a tablespoonful of sifted
flour, a little pepper and a teacupful of boiling water. Boil up
once and serve hot in a gravy boat.</p>
<p>Some prefer the clear gravy without the thickening. Serve with
mustard or grated horse-radish and vinegar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>YORKSHIRE PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>This is a very nice accompaniment to a roast of beef; the
ingredients are, one pint of milk, four eggs, whites and yolks
beaten separately, one teaspoonful of salt, and two teaspoonfuls of
baking powder sifted through two cups of flour. It should be mixed
very smooth, about the consistency of cream. Regulate your time
when you put in your roast, so that it will be done half an hour or
forty minutes before dishing up. Take it from the oven, set it
where it will keep hot. In the meantime have this pudding prepared.
Take two common biscuit tins, dip some of the drippings from the
dripping-pan into these tins, pour half of the pudding into each,
set them into the hot oven, and keep them in until the dinner is
dished up; take these puddings out at the last moment and send to
the table hot. This I consider much better than the old way of
baking the pudding under the meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFSTEAK. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>The first consideration in broiling is to have a clear, glowing
bed of coals. The steak should be about three-quarters of an inch
in thickness, and should be pounded only in extreme cases,
<i>i.e.</i>, when it is cut <i>too</i> thick and is "stringy." Lay
it on a buttered gridiron, turning it often, as it begins to drip,
attempting nothing else while cooking it. Have everything else
ready for the table; the potatoes and vegetables dished and in the
warming closet. Do not season it until it is done, <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 111]</span><a name='Page_111' id="Page_111"></a>which
will be in about ten to twelve minutes. Remove it to a warm
platter, pepper and salt it on both sides and spread a liberal lump
of butter over it. Serve at once while hot. No definite rule can be
given as to the <i>time</i> of cooking steak, individual tastes
differ so widely in regard to it, some only liking it when well
done, others so rare that the blood runs out of it. The best pieces
for broiling are the porterhouse and sirloin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFSTEAK. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Take a smooth, thick-bottomed frying pan, scald it out with hot
water, and wipe it dry; set it on the stove or range, and when
<i>very</i> hot, rub it over the bottom with a rag dipped in
butter; then place your steak or chops in it, turn often until
cooked through, take up on a warm platter, and season both sides
with salt, pepper and butter. Serve hot.</p>
<p>Many prefer this manner of cooking steak rather than broiling or
frying in a quantity of grease.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS.</b></p>
<p>Prepare the steak in the usual way. Have ready in a frying pan a
dozen onions cut in slices and fried brown in a little beef
drippings or butter. Dish your steak, and lay the onions thickly
over the top. Cover and let stand five minutes, then send to the
table hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFSTEAK AND OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Broil the steak the usual way. Put one quart of oysters with
very little of the liquor into a stewpan upon the fire; when it
comes to a boil, take off the scum that may rise, stir in three
ounces of butter mixed with a tablespoonful of sifted flour, let it
boil one minute until it thickens, pour it over the steak. Serve
hot.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Palace Hotel, San Francisco.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>TO FRY BEEFSTEAKS.</b></p>
<p>Beefsteak for frying should be cut much thinner than for
broiling. Take from the ribs or sirloin and remove the bone. Put
some butter or nice beef dripping into a frying pan and set it over
the fire, and when it has boiled and become hot lay in the steaks;
when cooked quite enough, season with salt and pepper, turn and
brown on both sides. Steaks when fried should be thoroughly done.
Have ready a hot dish, and when they are done take out the steaks
and lay them on <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]</span><a name=
'Page_112' id="Page_112"></a>it, with another dish cover the top to
keep them hot. The gravy in the pan can be turned over the steaks,
first adding a few drops of boiling water, or a gravy to be served
in a separate dish made by putting a large tablespoonful of flour
into the hot gravy left in the pan after taking up the steaks. Stir
it smooth, then pour in a pint of cream or sweet rich milk, salt
and pepper, let it boil up once until it thickens, pour hot into a
gravy dish and send to the table with the steaks.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POT ROAST. (Old Style.)</b></p>
<p>This is an old-fashioned dish, often cooked in our grandmothers'
time. Take a piece of fresh beef weighing about five or six pounds.
It must not be <i>too fat</i>. Wash it and put it into a pot with
barely sufficient water to cover it. Set it over a slow fire, and
after it has stewed an hour salt and pepper it. Then stew it slowly
until tender, adding a little onion if liked. Do not replenish the
water at the last, but let all nearly boil away. When tender all
through take the meat from the pot and pour the gravy in a bowl.
Put a large lump of butter in the bottom of the pot, then dredge
the piece of meat with flour and return it to the pot to brown,
turning it often to prevent its burning. Take the gravy that you
have poured from the meat into the bowl and skim off all the fat;
pour this gravy in with the meat and stir in a large spoonful of
flour wet with a little water; let it boil up ten or fifteen
minutes and pour into a gravy dish. Serve both hot, the meat on a
platter. Some are very fond of this way of cooking a piece of beef
which has been previously placed in spiced pickle for two or three
days.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPICED BEEF. (Excellent.)</b></p>
<p>For a round of beef weighing twenty or twenty-four pounds, take
one-quarter of a pound of saltpetre, one-quarter of a pound of
coarse brown sugar, two pounds of salt, one ounce of cloves, one
ounce of allspice and half an ounce of mace; pulverize these
materials, mix them well together, and with them rub the beef
thoroughly on every part; let the beef lie for eight or ten days in
the pickle thus made, turning and rubbing it every day; then tie it
around with a broad tape, to keep it in shape; make a coarse paste
of flour and water, lay a little suet finely chopped over and under
the beef, inclose the beef entirely in the paste, and bake it six
hours. When you take the beef from the oven, remove the paste, but
do not remove the tape until <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
113]</span><a name='Page_113' id="Page_113"></a>you are ready to
send it to the table. If you wish, to eat the beef cold, keep it
well covered that it may retain its moisture.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF &Aacute; LA MODE.</b></p>
<p>Mix together three teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pepper, one of
ginger, one of mace, one of cinnamon, and two of cloves. Rub this
mixture into ten pounds of the upper part of a round of beef. Let
this beef stand in this state over night. In the morning, make a
dressing or stuffing of a pint of fine bread crumbs, half a pound
of fat salt pork cut in dice, a teaspoonful of ground thyme or
summer savory, two teaspoonfuls sage, half a teaspoonful of pepper,
one of nutmeg, a little cloves, an onion minced fine, moisten with
a little milk or water. Stuff this mixture into the place from
whence you took out the bone. With a long skewer fasten the two
ends of the beef together, so that its form will be circular, and
bind it around with tape to prevent the skewers giving way. Make
incisions in the beef with a sharp knife; fill these incisions very
closely with the stuffing, and dredge the whole with flour.</p>
<p>Put it into a dripping-pan and pour over it a pint of hot water;
turn a large pan over it to keep in the steam, and roast slowly
from three to four hours, allowing a quarter of an hour to each
pound of meat. If the meat should be tough, it may be stewed first
in a pot, with water enough to cover it, until tender, and then put
into a dripping-pan and browned in the oven.</p>
<p>If the meat is to be eaten hot, skim off the fat from the gravy,
into which, after it is taken off the fire, stir in the beaten
yolks of two eggs. If onions are disliked you may omit them and
substitute minced oysters.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TENDERLOIN OF BEEF.</b></p>
<p>To serve tenderloin as directed below, the whole piece must be
extracted before the hind-quarter of the animal is cut out. This
must be particularly noted, because not commonly practiced, the
tenderloin being usually left attached to the roasting pieces, in
order to furnish a tidbit for a few. To dress it whole, proceed as
follows: Washing the piece well, put it in an oven; add about a
pint of water, and chop up a good handful of each of the following
vegetables as an ingredient of the dish, <i>viz.</i>, Irish
potatoes, carrots, turnips and a large bunch of <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 114]</span><a name='Page_114' id=
"Page_114"></a>celery. They must be washed, peeled and chopped up
raw, then added to the meat; blended with the juice, they form and
flavor the gravy. Let the whole slowly simmer, and when nearly
done, add a teaspoonful of pounded allspice. To give a richness to
the gravy, put in a tablespoonful of butter. If the gravy should
look too greasy, skim off some of the melted suet. Boil also a lean
piece of beef, which, when perfectly done, chop fine, flavoring
with a very small quantity of onion, besides pepper and salt to the
taste. Make into small balls, wet them on the outside with eggs,
roll in grated cracker or fine bread crumbs. Fry these force meat
balls a light brown. When serving the dish, put these around the
tenderloin, and pour over the whole the rich gravy. This dish is a
very handsome one, and, altogether, fit for an epicurean palate. A
sumptuous dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED STEAK WITH OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>Two pounds of rump steak, one pint of oysters, one tablespoonful
of lemon juice, three of butter, one of flour, salt, pepper, one
cupful of water. Wash the oysters in the water and drain into a
stewpan. Put this liquor on to heat. As soon as it comes to a boil,
skim and set back. Put the butter in a frying pan, and when hot,
put in a steak. Cook ten minutes. Take up the steak, and stir the
flour into the butter remaining in the pan. Stir until a dark
brown. Add the oyster liquor and boil one minute. Season with salt
and pepper. Put back the steak, cover the pan, and simmer half an
hour or until the steak seems tender, then add the oysters and
lemon juice. Boil one minute. Serve on a hot dish with points of
toast for a garnish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SMOTHERED BEEFSTEAK.</b></p>
<p>Take <i>thin</i> slices of steak from the upper part of the
round or one large thin steak. Lay the meat out smoothly and wipe
it dry. Prepare a dressing, using a cupful of fine bread crumbs,
half a teaspoonful of salt, some pepper, a tablespoonful of butter,
half a teaspoonful of sage, the same of powdered summer savory, and
enough milk to moisten it all into a stiff mixture. Spread it over
the meat, roll it up carefully, and tie with a string, securing the
ends well. Now fry a few thin slices of salt pork in the bottom of
a kettle or saucepan, and into the fat that has fried out of this
pork, place this roll or rolls of beef, and brown it on all sides,
turning it until a rich color all over, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
115]</span><a name='Page_115' id="Page_115"></a>then add half a
pint of water, and stew until tender. If the flavor of onion is
liked, a slice may be chopped fine and added to the dressing. When
cooked sufficiently, take out the meat, thicken the gravy, and turn
over it. To be carved cutting crosswise, in slices, through beef
and stuffing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFSTEAK ROLLS.</b></p>
<p>This mode is similar to the above recipe, but many might prefer
it.</p>
<p>Prepare a good dressing, such as you like for turkey or duck;
take a round steak, pound it, but not very hard, spread the
dressing over it, sprinkle in a little salt, pepper, and a few bits
of butter, lap over the ends, roll the steak up tightly and tie
closely; spread two great spoonfuls of butter over the steak after
rolling it up, then wash with a well-beaten egg, put water in the
bake-pan, lay in the steak so as not to touch the water, and bake
as you would a duck, basting often. A half-hour in a brisk oven
will bake. Make a brown gravy and send to the table hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO COLLAR A FLANK OF BEEF.</b></p>
<p>Procure a well-corned flank of beef&mdash;say six pounds. Wash
it, and remove the inner and outer skin with the gristle. Prepare a
seasoning of one teaspoonful each of sage, parsley, thyme, pepper
and cloves. Lay your meat upon a board and spread this mixture over
the inside. Roll the beef up tight, fasten it with small skewers,
put a cloth over it, bandage the cloth with tape, put the beef into
the stewpot, cover it with water to the depth of an inch, boil
gently six hours; take it out of the water, place it on a board
without undoing it; lay a board on top of the beef, put a fifty
pound weight upon this board, and let it remain twenty-four hours.
Take off the bandage, garnish with green pickles and curled
parsley, and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRIED BEEF.</b></p>
<p>Buy the best of beef, or that part which will be the most lean
and tender. The tender part of the round is a very good piece. For
every twenty pounds of beef use one pint of salt, one teaspoonful
of saltpetre, and a quarter of a pound of brown sugar. Mix them
well together, and rub the beef well with one-third of the mixture
for three successive days. Let it lie in the liquor it makes for
six days, then hang up to dry.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]</span><a name='Page_116' id=
"Page_116"></a>
<p>A large crock or jar is a good vessel to prepare the meat in
before drying it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF CORNED OR SALTED. (Red.)</b></p>
<p>Cut up a quarter of beef. For each hundred weight take half a
peck of coarse salt, a quarter of a pound of saltpetre, the same
weight of saleratus and a quart of molasses, or two pounds of
coarse brown sugar. Mace, cloves and allspice may be added for
spiced beef.</p>
<p>Strew some of the salt in the bottom of a pickle-tub or barrel,
then put in a layer of meat, strew this with salt, then add another
layer of meat, and salt and meat alternately, until all is used.
Let it remain one night. Dissolve the saleratus and saltpetre in a
little warm water, and put it to the molasses or sugar; then put it
over the meat, add water enough to cover the meat, lay a board on
it to keep it under the brine. The meat is fit for use after ten
days. This recipe is for winter beef. Rather more salt may be used
in warm weather.</p>
<p>Towards spring take the brine from the meat, make it boiling
hot, skim it clear, and when it is cooled, return it to the
meat.</p>
<p>Beef tongues and smoking pieces are fine pickled in this brine.
Beef liver put in this brine for ten days, and then wiped dry and
smoked, is very fine. Cut it in slices, and fry or broil it. The
brisket of beef, after being corned, may be smoked, and is very
good for boiling.</p>
<p>Lean pieces of beef, cut properly from the hind-quarter, are the
proper pieces for being smoked. There may be some fine pieces cut
from the fore-quarter.</p>
<p>After the beef has been in brine ten days or more, wipe it dry,
and hang it in a chimney where wood is burned, or make a smothered
fire of sawdust or chips, and keep it smoking for ten days; then
rub fine black pepper over every part to keep the flies from it,
and hang it in a <i>dry, dark, cool place</i>. After a week it is
fit for use. A strong, coarse brown paper, folded around the beef,
and fastened with paste, keeps it nicely.</p>
<p>Tongues are smoked in the same manner. Hang them by a string put
through the root end. Spiced brine for smoked beef or tongues will
be generally liked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST BEEF PIE WITH POTATO CRUST.</b></p>
<p>When you have a cold roast of beef, cut off as much as will half
fill a baking-dish suited to the size of your family; put this
sliced <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]</span><a name='Page_117' id=
"Page_117"></a>beef into a stewpan with any gravy that you may have
also saved, a lump of butter, a bit of sliced onion and a seasoning
of pepper and salt, with enough water to make plenty of gravy;
thicken it, too, by dredging in a tablespoonful of flour; cover it
up on the fire, where it may stew gently, but not be in danger of
burning. Meanwhile there must be boiled a sufficient quantity of
potatoes to fill up your baking-dish, after the stewed meat has
been transferred to it. The potatoes must be boiled done, mashed
smooth, and beaten up with milk and butter, as if they were to be
served alone, and placed in a thick layer on top of the meat. Brush
it over with egg, place the dish in an oven, and let it remain
there long enough to be brown. There should be a goodly quantity of
gravy left with the beef, that the dish be not dry and tasteless.
Serve with it tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce or any other kind
that you prefer. A good, plain dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST BEEF PIE.</b></p>
<p>Cut up roast beef, or beefsteak left from a previous meal, into
thin slices, lay some of the slices into a deep dish which you have
lined <i>on the sides</i> with rich biscuit dough, rolled very thin
(say a quarter of an inch thick); now sprinkle over this layer a
little pepper and salt; put in a small bit of butter, a few slices
of cold potatoes, a little of the cold gravy, if you have any left
from the roast. Make another layer of beef, another layer of
seasoning, and so on, until the dish is filled; cover the whole
with paste leaving a slit in the centre, and bake half an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFSTEAK PIE.</b></p>
<p>Cut up rump or flank steak into strips two inches long and about
an inch wide. Stew them with the bone, in just enough water to
cover them, until partly cooked; have half a dozen of cold boiled
potatoes sliced. Line a baking-dish with pie paste, put in a layer
of the meat with salt, pepper, and a little of thinly-sliced onion,
then one of the sliced potatoes, with bits of butter dotted over
them. Then the steak, alternated with layers of potato, until the
dish is full. Add the gravy or broth, having first thickened it
with brown flour. Cover with a top crust, making a slit in the
middle; brush a little beaten egg over it, and bake until quite
brown.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]</span><a name='Page_118' id=
"Page_118"></a>
<p><b>FRIZZLED BEEF.</b></p>
<p>Shave off <i>very thin</i> slices of smoked or dried beef, put
them in a frying pan, cover with cold water, set it on the back of
the range or stove, and let it come to a very slow heat, allowing
it time to swell out to its natural size, but not to boil. Stir it
up, then drain off the water. Melt one ounce of sweet butter in the
frying pan and add the wafers of beef. When they begin to frizzle
or turn up, break over them three eggs; stir until the eggs are
cooked; add a little white pepper, and serve on slices of buttered
toast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLANK STEAK.</b></p>
<p>This is cut from the boneless part of the flank and is secreted
between an outside and inside layer of creamy fat. There are two
ways for broiling it. One is to slice diagonally across the grain;
the other is to broil it whole. In either case brush butter over it
and proceed as in broiling other steaks. It is considered by
butchers the finest steak, which they frequently reserve for
themselves.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BOIL CORNED BEEF.</b></p>
<p>The aitch-bone and the brisket are considered the best pieces
for boiling. If you buy them in the market already corned, they
will be fit to put over the fire without a previous soaking in
water. If you corn them in the brine in which you keep your beef
through the winter, they must be soaked in cold water over night.
Put the beef into a pot, cover with sufficient <i>cold</i> water,
place over a brisk fire, let it come to a boil in half an hour;
just before boiling remove all the scum from the pot, place the pot
on the back of the fire, let it boil very slowly until quite
tender.</p>
<p>A piece weighing eight pounds requires two and a half hours'
boiling. If you do not wish to eat it hot, let it remain in the pot
after you take it from the fire until nearly cold, then lay it in a
colander to drain, lay a cloth over it to retain its fresh
appearance; serve with horse-radish and pickles.</p>
<p>If vegetables are to accompany this, making it the old-fashioned
"boiled dinner," about three-quarters of an hour before dishing up
skim the liquor free from fat and <i>turn part of it out into
another kettle</i>, into which put a cabbage carefully prepared,
cutting it into four quarters; also half a dozen peeled
medium-sized white turnips, cut <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
119]</span><a name='Page_119' id="Page_119"></a>into halves; scrape
four carrots and four parsnips each cut into four pieces. Into the
kettle with the meat, about half an hour before serving, pour on
more water from the boiling tea-kettle, and into this put peeled
medium-sized potatoes. This dinner should also be accompanied by
boiled beets, sliced hot, cooked separate from the rest, with
vinegar over them. Cooking the cabbage separately from the meat
prevents the meat from having the flavor of cabbage when cold. The
carrots, parsnips and turnips will boil in about an hour. A piece
of salt pork was usually boiled with a "New England boiled
dinner."</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPICED BEEF RELISH.</b></p>
<p>Take two pounds of raw, tender beefsteak, chop it <i>very
fine</i>, put into it salt, pepper and a little sage, two
tablespoonfuls of melted butter; add two rolled crackers made very
fine, also two well-beaten eggs. Make it up into the shape of a
roll and bake it; baste with butter and water before baking. Cut in
slices when cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED BEEF LIVER.</b></p>
<p>Cut it in rather thin slices, say a quarter of an inch thick;
pour over it <i>boiling</i> water, which closes the pores of the
meat, makes it impervious to the fat, and at the same time seals up
the rich juice of the meat. It may be rolled in flour or bread
crumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped in egg and fried in
hot fat mixed with one-third butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESSED BEEF.</b></p>
<p>First have your beef nicely pickled; let it stay in pickle a
week; then take the thin, flanky pieces, such as will not make a
handsome dish of themselves, put on a large potful, and let them
boil until perfectly done; then pull to pieces, and season just as
you do souse, with pepper, salt and allspice; only put it in a
coarse cloth and press down upon it some very heavy weight.</p>
<p>The advantage of this recipe is that it makes a most acceptable,
presentable dish out of a part of the beef that otherwise might be
wasted.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH STEW.</b></p>
<p>Grease the bottom of an iron pot, and place in it three or four
pounds of beef; be very careful that it does not burn, and turn it
until it is nicely browned. Set a muffin ring under the beef to
pre<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]</span><a name='Page_120' id=
"Page_120"></a>vent its sticking. Add a few sliced carrots, one or
two sliced onions, and a cupful of hot water; keep covered and stew
slowly until the vegetables are done. Add pepper and salt. If you
wish more gravy, add hot water, and thicken with flour. Serve on a
dish with the vegetables.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO POT BEEF.</b></p>
<p>The round is the best piece for potting, and you may use both
the upper and under part. Take ten pounds of beef, remove all the
fat, cut the lean into square pieces, two inches thick. Mix
together three teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pepper, one of cloves,
one of mace, one of cinnamon, one of allspice, one of thyme, and
one of sweet basil. Put a layer of the pieces of beef into an
earthen pot, sprinkle some of this spice mixture over this layer,
add a piece of fat salt pork, cut as thin as possible, sprinkle a
little of the spice mixture over the pork, make another layer of
the beef with spices and pork, and so on, until the pot is filled.
Pour over the whole three tablespoonfuls of Tarragon vinegar, or,
if you prefer it, half a pint of Madeira wine; cover the pot with a
paste made of flour and water, so that no steam can escape. Put the
pot into an oven, moderately heated, and let it stand there eight
hours; then set it away to use when wanted.</p>
<p>Beef cooked in this manner will keep good for a fortnight in
moderate weather.</p>
<p>It is an excellent relish for breakfast, and may be eaten either
warm or cold. When eaten warm, serve with slices of lemon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED BRISKET OF BEEF.</b></p>
<p>Put the part that has the hard fat into a stewpot with a small
quantity of water; let it boil up and skim it thoroughly; then add
carrots, turnips, onions, celery and a few pepper-corns. Stew till
extremely tender; then take out all the flat bones and remove all
the fat from the soup. Either serve that and the meat in tureen, or
the soup alone, and the meat on a dish garnished with some
vegetables. The following sauce is much admired served with the
beef: Take half a pint of the soup and mix it with a spoonful of
catsup, a teaspoonful of made mustard, a little flour, a bit of
butter and salt; boil all together a few minutes, then pour it
round the meat.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]</span><a name='Page_121' id=

<p><b>DRIED BEEF WITH CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Shave your beef <i>very fine</i>. Put it into a suitable dish on
the back of the stove; cover with cold water and give it time to
soak out to its original size before being dried. When it is quite
soft and the water has become hot (it must not boil) take it off,
turn off the water, pour on a cup of cream; if you do not have it
use milk and butter, a pinch of pepper; let it come to a boil,
thicken with a tablespoonful of flour wet up in a little milk.
Serve on dipped toast or not, just as one fancies. A nice breakfast
dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF CROQUETTES. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Chop fine one cup of cold, cooked, lean beef, half a cup of fat,
half a cup of cold boiled or fried ham; cold pork will do if you
have not the ham. Also mince up a slice of onion. Season all with a
teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and a
teaspoonful of powdered sage or parsley if liked. Heat together
with half a cup of stock or milk; when cool add a beaten egg. Form
the mixture into balls, slightly flattened, roll in egg and bread
crumbs, or flour and egg. Fry in hot lard or beef drippings. Serve
on a platter and garnish with sprigs of parsley. Almost any cold
meats can be used instead of beef.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF CROQUETTES. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Take cold roast or corned beef. Put it into a wooden bowl and
chop it fine. Mix with it about twice the quantity of hot mashed
potatoes well seasoned with butter and salt. Beat up an egg and
work it into the potato and meat, then form the mixture into little
cakes the size of fish balls. Flatten them a little, roll in flour
or egg and cracker crumbs, fry in butter and lard mixed, browning
on both sides. Serve piping hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MEAT AND POTATO CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>Put in a stewpan an ounce of butter and a slice of onion minced
fine; when this simmers add a level tablespoonful of sifted flour;
stir the mixture until it becomes smooth and frothy; then add half
of a cupful of milk, some seasoning of salt and pepper; let all
boil, stirring it all the while. Now add a cupful of cold meat
chopped fine, and a cupful of cold or hot mashed potato. Mix all
thoroughly and spread on a plate to cool. When it is cool enough,
shape it with your hands into balls or rolls. Dip them in beaten
egg and roll in cracker <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
122]</span><a name='Page_122' id="Page_122"></a>or bread crumbs.
Drop them into hot lard and fry about two minutes a delicate brown;
take them out with a skimmer and drain them on a piece of brown
paper. Serve immediately while hot. These are very nice.</p>
<p>Cold rice or hominy may be used in place of the potato; or a
cupful of cold fish minced fine in place of the meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD ROAST, WARMED. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Cut from the remains of a cold roast the lean meat from the
bones into small, thin slices. Put over the fire a frying pan
containing a spoonful of butter or drippings. Cut up a quarter of
an onion and fry it brown, then remove the onion, add the meat
gravy left from the day before, and if not thick enough add a
little flour; salt and pepper. Turn the pieces of meat into this
and let them <i>simmer</i> a few minutes. Serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD ROAST, WARMED. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Cold rare roast beef may be made as good as when freshly cooked
by slicing, seasoning with salt, pepper and bits of butter; put it
in a plate or pan with a spoonful or two of water, covering
closely, and set in the oven until hot, but no longer. Cold steak
may be shaved very fine with a knife and used the same way.</p>
<p>Or, if the meat is in small pieces, cover them with buttered
letter paper, twist each end tightly, and boil them on the
gridiron, sprinkling them with finely chopped herbs.</p>
<p>Still another nice way of using cold meats is to mince the lean
portions very fine and add to a batter made of one pint of milk,
one cup of flour and three eggs. Fry like fritters and serve with
drawn butter or sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD MEAT AND POTATO, BAKED.</b></p>
<p>Put in a frying pan a round tablespoonful of cold butter; when
it becomes hot, stir into it a teaspoonful of chopped onion and a
tablespoonful of flour, stirring it constantly until it is smooth
and frothy; then add two-thirds of a cupful of cold milk or water.
Season this with salt and pepper and allow it to come to a boil;
then add a cupful of cold meat finely chopped and cleared from bone
and skin; let this all heat thoroughly; then turn it into a shallow
dish well buttered. Spread hot or cold mashed potatoes over the
top, and cook for fifteen or twenty minutes in a moderate hot
oven.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 123]</span><a name='Page_123' id=

<p>Cold hominy, or rice may be used in place of mashed potatoes,
and is equally as good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF HASH. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Chop rather finely cold roast beef or pieces of beefsteak, also
chop twice as much cold boiled potatoes. Put over the fire a
stewpan or frying pan, in which put a piece of butter as large as
required to season it well, add pepper and salt, moisten with beef
gravy if you have it, if not, with hot water; cover and let it
steam and heat through thoroughly, stirring occasionally, so that
the ingredients be evenly distributed, and to keep the hash from
sticking to the bottom of the pan. When done it should not be at
all watery, nor yet dry, but have sufficient adhesiveness to stand
well on a dish or buttered toast. Many like the flavor of onion; if
so, fry two or three slices in the butter before adding the hash.
Corned beef makes excellent hash.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF HASH. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Chop cold roast beef, or pieces of beefsteak; fry half an onion
in a piece of butter; when the onion is brown, add the chopped
beef; season with a little salt and pepper; moisten with the beef
gravy, if you have any, if not, with sufficient water and a little
butter; cook long enough to be hot, but no longer, as much cooking
toughens the meat. An excellent breakfast dish.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Prof. Blot.</i></div>
<p>Some prefer to let a crust form on the bottom and turn the hash
brown side uppermost. Served with poached eggs on top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HAMBURGER STEAK.</b></p>
<p>Take a pound of raw flank or round steak, without any fat, bone
or stringy pieces. Chop it until a perfect mince, it cannot be
chopped too fine. Also chop a small onion quite fine and mix well
with the meat. Season with salt and pepper; make into cakes as
large as a biscuit, but quite flat, or into one large flat cake a
little less than half an inch thick. Have ready a frying pan with
butter and lard mixed; when boiling hot put in the steak and fry
brown. Garnish with celery top around the edge of the platter and
two or three slices of lemon on the top of the meat.</p>
<p>A brown gravy made from the grease the steak was fried in and
poured over the meat enriches it.</p>

<p><b>TO ROAST BEEF HEART.</b></p>
<p>Wash it carefully and open it sufficiently to remove the
ventricles, then soak it in cold water until the blood is
discharged; wipe it dry and stuff it nicely with dressing, as for
turkey; roast it about an hour and a half. Serve it with the gravy,
which should be thickened with some of the stuffing and a glass of
wine. It is very nice hashed. Served with currant jelly.</p>

<br>
<p><b>STEWED BEEF KIDNEY.</b></p>
<p>Cut the kidney into slices, season highly with pepper and salt,
fry it a light brown, take out the slices, then pour a little warm
water into the pan, dredge in some flour, put in slices of kidney
again; let them stew very gently; add some parsley if liked.
Sheep's kidneys may be split open, broiled over a clear fire and
served with a piece of butter placed on each half.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFS HEART STEWED.</b></p>
<p>After washing the heart thoroughly cut it up into squares half
an inch long; put them into a saucepan with water enough to cover
them. If any scum rises skim it off. Now take out the meat, strain
the liquor and put back the meat, also add a sliced onion, some
parsley, a head of celery chopped fine, pepper and salt and a piece
of butter. Stew until the meat is very tender. Stir up a
tablespoonful of browned flour with a small quantity of water and
thicken the whole. Boil up and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED BEEF TONGUE.</b></p>
<p>Wash a fresh tongue and just cover it with water in the pot; put
in a pint of salt and a small red pepper; add more water as it
evaporates, so as to keep the tongue nearly covered until
done&mdash;when it can be easily pierced with a fork; take it out,
and if wanted soon, take off the skin and set it away to cool. If
wanted for future use, do not peel until it is required. A cupful
of salt will do for three tongues, if you have that number to boil;
but do not fail to keep water enough in the pot to keep them
covered while boiling. If salt tongues are used, soak them over
night, of course omitting the salt when boiling. Or, after peeling
a tongue, place it in a saucepan with one cup of water, half a cup
vinegar, four tablespoonfuls sugar, and cook until the liquor is
evaporated.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 125]</span><a name='Page_125' id=
"Page_125"></a>
<p><b>SPICED BEEF TONGUE.</b></p>
<p>Rub into each tongue a mixture made of half a pound of brown
sugar, a piece of saltpetre the size of a pea and a tablespoonful
of ground cloves, put it in a brine made of three-quarters of a
pound of salt to two quarts of water and keep covered. Pickle two
weeks, then wash well and dry with a cloth; roll out a thin paste
made of flour and water, smear it all over the tongue and place in
a pan to bake slowly; baste well with lard and hot water; when done
scrape off the paste and skim.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BOIL TRIPE.</b></p>
<p>Wash it well in warm water, and trim it nicely, taking off all
the fat. Cut into small pieces, and put it on to boil five hours
before dinner in water enough to cover it very well. After it has
boiled four hours, pour off the water, season the tripe with pepper
and salt, and put it into a pot with milk and water mixed in equal
quantities. Boil it an hour in the milk and water.</p>
<p>Boil in a saucepan ten or a dozen onions. When they are quite
soft, drain them in a colander and mash them. Wipe out your
saucepan and put them on again, with a bit of butter rolled in
flour and a wine-glass of cream or milk. Let them boil up, and add
them to the tripe just before you send it to table. Eat it with
pepper, vinegar and mustard.</p>
<p>It is best to give tripe its first and longest boiling the day
before it is wanted.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO FRY TRIPE.</b></p>
<p>Boil the tripe the day before till it is quite tender, which it
will not be in less than four or five hours. Then cover it and set
it away. Next day cut it into long slips, and dip each piece into
beaten yolk of egg, and afterwards roll them in grated bread
crumbs. Have ready in a frying pan over the fire some good beef
drippings. When it is boiling hot put in the tripe, and fry it
about ten minutes, till of a light brown.</p>
<p>You may serve it with onion sauce.</p>
<p>Boiled tripe that has been left from the dinner of the preceding
day may be fried in this manner.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 126]</span><a name='Page_126' id=
"Page_126"></a>
<p><b>FRICASSEED TRIPE.</b></p>
<p>Cut a pound of tripe in narrow strips, put a small cup of water
or milk to it, add a bit of butter the size of an egg, dredge in a
large teaspoonful of flour, or work it with the butter; season with
pepper and salt, let it simmer gently for half an hour, serve hot.
A bunch of parsley cut small and put with it is an improvement.</p>
<p>Some put in oysters five minutes before dishing up.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TRIPE LYONNAISE.</b></p>
<p>Cut up half a pound of cold boiled tripe into neat squares. Put
two ounces of butter and a tablespoonful of chopped onion in a
frying pan and fry to a delicate brown; add to the tripe a
teaspoonful of chopped parsley and a little strong vinegar, salt
and cayenne; stir the pan to prevent burning. Cover the bottom of a
platter with tomato sauce, add the contents of the pan and
serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLARIFY BEEF DRIPPINGS.</b></p>
<p>Drippings accumulated from different cooked meats of beef or
veal can be clarified by putting it into a basin and slicing into
it a raw potato, allowing it to boil long enough for the potato to
brown, which causes all impurities to disappear. Remove from the
fire, and when cool drain it off from the sediment that settles at
the bottom. Turn it into basins or small jars and set it in a cool
place for future use. When mixed with an equal amount of butter it
answers the same purpose as clear butter for frying and basting any
meats except game and poultry.</p>
<p>Mutton drippings impart an unpleasant flavor to anything cooked
outside of its kind.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST LOIN OF VEAL.</b></p>
<p>Prepare it the same as any roast, leaving in the kidney, around
which put considerable salt. Make a dressing the same as for fowls;
unroll the loin, put the stuffing well around the kidney, fold and
secure with several coils of white cotton twine wound around in all
directions; place in a dripping-pan with the thick side down, and
put in a rather hot oven, graduated after it commences to roast to
moderate; in half an hour add a little hot water to the pan, and
baste often; in another half hour turn over the roast, and when
about done dredge lightly with flour and baste with melted butter.
Before serving care<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 127]</span><a name=
'Page_127' id="Page_127"></a>fully remove the twine. A roast of
four to five pounds will bake in about two hours. For a gravy, skim
off some of the fat if there is too much in the drippings; dredge
in some flour, stir until brown, add some hot water if necessary;
boil a few minutes, stir in such sweet herbs as fancied, and put in
a gravy boat. Serve with green peas and lemon jelly. Is very nice
sliced cold for lunch, and Worcestershire or Chili sauce forms a
fine relish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST FILLET OF VEAL.</b></p>
<p>Select a nice fillet, take out the bone, fill up the space with
stuffing, and also put a good layer under the fat. Truss it of a
good shape by drawing the fat round and tie it up with tape. Cook
it rather moderately at first, and baste with butter. It should
have careful attention and frequent basting, that the fat may not
burn. Roast from three to four hours, according to the size. After
it is dished pour melted butter over it; serve with ham or bacon,
and fresh cucumbers if in season. Veal, like all other meat, should
be well washed in cold water before cooking and wiped thoroughly
dry with a clean cloth. Cold fillet of veal is very good stewed
with tomatoes and an onion or two.</p>
<p>In roasting veal, care must be taken that it is not at first
placed in too hot an oven; the fat of a loin, one of the most
delicate joints of veal, should be covered with greased paper; a
fillet, also, should have on the caul until nearly done enough.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED FILLET OF VEAL.</b></p>
<p>Choose a small, delicate fillet; prepare as for roasting, or
stuff it with an oyster force meat; after having washed it
thoroughly, cover it with water and let it boil very gently three
and a half or four hours, keeping it well skimmed. Send it to the
table with a rich white sauce, or, if stuffed with oysters, a
tureen of oyster sauce. Garnish with stewed celery and slices of
bacon. A boiled tongue should be served with it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Cut about two pounds of lean veal into small collops a quarter
of an inch in thickness; put a piece of butter the size of an egg
into a very clean frying pan to melt; then lay in the veal and a
few slices of bacon, a small sprig of thyme and a seasoning of
pepper and salt; place <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
128]</span><a name='Page_128' id="Page_128"></a>the pan over a slow
fire for about ten minutes, then add two or three spoonfuls of warm
water. Just boil it up and then let it stand to cool. Line a
pudding-dish with a good suet crust, lay in the veal and bacon,
pour the gravy over it; roll out a piece of paste to form a lid,
place it over, press it close with the thumb, tie the basin in a
pudding cloth and put it into a saucepan of boiling water, keeping
continually boiling until done, or about one hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED VEAL CUTLETS.</b></p>
<p>Put into a frying pan two or three tablespoonfuls of lard or
beef drippings. When boiling hot lay in the cutlets, well seasoned
with salt and pepper and dredged with flour. Brown nicely on both
sides, then remove the meat, and if you have more grease than is
necessary for the gravy put it aside for further use. Reserve a
tablespoonful or more and rub into it a tablespoonful of flour,
with the back of the spoon, until it is a smooth, rich brown color;
then add gradually a cup of <i>cold water</i> and season with
pepper and salt. When the gravy is boiled up well return the meat
to the pan and gravy. Cover it closely and allow it to stew gently
on the back of the range for fifteen minutes. This softens the
meat, and with this gravy it makes a nice breakfast dish.</p>
<p>Another mode is to simply fry the cutlets, and afterwards
turning off some of the grease they were fried in and then adding
to that left in the pan a few drops of hot water, turning the whole
over the fried chops.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED VEAL CHOPS. (Plain.)</b></p>
<p>Sprinkle over them salt and pepper, then dip them in beaten egg
and cracker crumbs, and fry in drippings, or hot lard and butter
mixed. If you wish a gravy with them, add a tablespoonful of flour
to the gravy they were fried in and turn in cream or milk; season
to taste with salt and pepper. Boil up and serve hot with the gravy
in separate dish. This dish is very fine accompanied with a few
sound fresh tomatoes, sliced and fried in the same grease the
cutlets were, and all dished on the same platter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL COLLOPS.</b></p>
<p>Cut veal from the leg or other lean part into pieces the size of
an oyster. Season with pepper, salt and a little mace; rub some
over <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 129]</span><a name='Page_129' id=
"Page_129"></a>each piece; dip in egg, then into cracker crumbs and
fry. They both look and taste like oysters.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL OLIVES.</b></p>
<p>Cut up a slice of a fillet of veal, about half an inch thick,
into squares of three inches. Mix up a little salt pork, chopped
with bread crumbs, one onion, a little pepper, salt, sweet
marjoram, and one egg well beaten; put this mixture upon the pieces
of veal, fastening the four corners together with little bird
skewers; lay them in a pan with sufficient veal gravy or light
stock to cover the bottom of the pan, dredge with flour and set in
a hot oven. When browned on top, put a small bit of butter on each,
and let them remain until quite tender, which will take twenty
minutes. Serve with horse-radish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL CHEESE.</b></p>
<p>Prepare equal quantities of boiled sliced veal and smoked
tongue. Pound the slices separately in a mortar, moistening with
butter as you proceed; then pack it in a jar or pail, mixing it in
alternate layers; first the tongue and then the veal, so that when
cut it will look variegated. Press it down hard and pour melted
butter over the top. Keep it well covered and in a dry place. Nice
for sandwiches, or sliced cold for lunch.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>Mince a coffee cup of cold veal in a chopping bowl, adding a
little cold ham and two or three slices of onion, a pinch of mace,
powdered parsley and pepper, some salt. Let a pint of milk or cream
come to the boiling point, then add a tablespoonful of cold butter,
then the above mixture. Beat up two eggs and mix with a teaspoonful
of cornstarch or flour, and add to the rest; cook it all about ten
minutes, stirring with care. Remove from the fire, and spread it on
a platter, roll it into balls, when cooled flatten each; dip them
in egg and bread crumbs, and fry in a wire basket, dipped in hot
lard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED VEAL CUTLETS. (Fine.)</b></p>
<p>Two or three pounds of veal cutlets, egg and bread crumbs, two
tablespoonfuls of minced savory herbs, salt and pepper to taste, a
little grated nutmeg.</p>
<p>Cut the cutlets about three-quarters of an inch in thickness;
flatten them, and brush them over with the yolk of an egg; dip them
into <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 130]</span><a name='Page_130' id=
"Page_130"></a>bread crumbs and minced herbs, season with pepper
and salt, and fold each cutlet in a piece of white letter paper
well buttered; twist the ends, and broil over a clear fire; when
done remove the paper. Cooked this way, they retain all the
flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL POT-PIE.</b></p>
<p>Procure a nice breast or brisket of veal, well jointed, put the
pieces into the pot with one quart of water to every five pounds of
meat; put the pot over a slow fire; just before it comes to a boil,
skim it well and pour in a teacupful of cold water; then turn over
the meat in order that all the scum may rise; remove all the scum,
boil quite hard, season with pepper and salt to your taste, always
remembering that the crust will take up part of the seasoning; when
this is done cut off your crust in pieces of equal size, but do not
roll or mould them; lay them on top of the meat, so as to cover it;
put the lid on the pot closely, let the whole boil slowly one hour.
If the lid does not fit the pot closely, wrap a cloth around it, in
order that no steam shall escape; and by no means allow the pot to
<i>stop boiling</i>.</p>
<p>The crust for pot-pie should be raised with yeast. To three
pints of flour add two ounces of butter, a little salt, and wet
with milk sufficient to make a soft dough; knead it well and set it
away to rise; when quite light, mould and knead it again, and let
it stand, in winter, one hour, in summer, one-half hour, when it
will be ready to cut.</p>
<p>In summer you had better add one-half a teaspoonful of soda when
you knead it the second time, or you may wet it with water and add
another bit of butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL PIE.</b></p>
<p>Cut the veal into rather small pieces or slices, put it in a
stewpan with hot water to cover it; add to it a tablespoonful of
salt and set it over the fire; take off the scum as it rises; when
the meat is tender turn it into a dish to cool; take out all the
small bones, butter a tin or earthen basin or pudding-pan, line it
with pie paste, lay some of the parboiled meat in to half fill it;
put bits of butter in the size of a hickory nut all over the meat;
shake pepper over, dredge wheat flour over until it looks white,
then fill it nearly to the top with some of the water in which the
meat was boiled; roll a cover for the top of the crust, puff-paste
it, giving it two or three turns, and roll it to nearly half
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 131]</span><a name='Page_131' id=
"Page_131"></a>an inch thickness; cut a slit in the centre and make
several small incisions on either side of it, put the crust on,
trim the edges neatly with a knife; bake one hour in a quick oven.
A breast of veal will make two two-quart basin pies; half a pound
of nice corned pork, cut in thin slices and parboiled with the
meat, will make it very nice, and very little, if any, butter will
be required for the pie; when pork is used not other salt will be
necessary. Many are fond of thin slices of sweet ham cooked with
the veal for pie.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL STEW.</b></p>
<p>Cut up two or three pounds of veal into pieces three inches long
and one thick. Wash it, put it into your stewpan with two quarts of
water, let it boil, skim it well, and when all the scum is removed,
add pepper and salt to your taste, and a small piece of butter;
pare and cut in halves twelve small Irish potatoes, put them into
the stewpan; when it boils, have ready a batter made with two eggs,
two spoonfuls of cream or milk, a little salt, and flour enough to
make it a little thicker than for pancakes; drop this into the
stew, a spoonful at a time, while it is boiling; when all is in,
cover the pan closely so that no steam can escape; let it boil
twenty minutes and serve in a deep dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL LOAF.</b></p>
<p>Three pounds of raw veal chopped very fine, butter the size of
an egg, three eggs, three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk; if milk
use a small piece of butter; mix the eggs and cream together; mix
with the veal four pounded crackers, one teaspoonful of black
pepper, one large tablespoonful salt, one large tablespoonful of
sage; mix well together and form into a loaf. Bake two and one-half
hours, basting with butter and water while baking. Serve cut in
thin slices.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL FOR LUNCH.</b></p>
<p>Butter a good-sized bowl, and line it with thin slices of
hard-boiled eggs; have veal and ham both in very thin slices;
place, in the bowl a layer of veal, with pepper and salt, then a
layer of ham, omitting the salt, then a layer of veal, and so on,
alternating with veal and ham, until the bowl is filled; make a
paste of flour and water as stiff as it can be rolled out; cover
the contents of the bowl with the paste, and over this tie a double
cotton cloth; put the bowl into a saucepan, <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 132]</span><a name='Page_132' id="Page_132"></a>or
other vessel, with water just up to the rim of the bowl, and boil
three hours; then take it from the fire, remove the cloth and
paste, and let it stand until the next day, when it may be turned
out and served in very thin slices. An excellent lunch in
traveling.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL PATTIES.</b></p>
<p>Cut portions of the neck or breast of veal into small pieces,
and, with a little salt pork cut fine, stew gently for ten or
fifteen minutes; season with pepper and salt, and a small piece of
celery chopped coarsely, also of the yellow top, picked (not
chopped) up; stir in a paste made of a tablespoonful of flour, the
yolk of one egg, and milk to form a thin batter; let all come to a
boil, and it is ready for the patties. Make the patties of a light,
flaky crust, as for tarts, cut round, the size of a small
sauceplate; the centre of each, for about three inches, cut half
way through, to be raised and serve as a cover. Put a spoonful of
the stew in each crust, lay on the top and serve. Stewed oysters or
lamb may be used in place of veal.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BRAISED VEAL.</b></p>
<p>Take a piece of the shoulder weighing about five pounds. Have
the bone removed and tie up the meat to make it firm. Put a piece
of butter the size of half an egg, together with a few shavings of
onion, into a kettle or stone crock and let it get hot. Salt and
pepper the veal and put it into the kettle, cover it tightly and
put it over a medium fire until the meat is brown on both sides,
turning it occasionally. Then set the kettle back on the stove,
where it will simmer slowly for about two hours and a half. Before
setting the meat back on the stove, see if the juice of the meat
together with the butter do not make gravy enough, and if not, put
in about two tablespoonfuls of hot water. When the gravy is cold it
will be like jelly. It can be served hot with the hot meat, or cold
with the cold meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED CALF'S HEAD.</b></p>
<p>Boil a calf's head (after having cleaned it) until tender, then
split it in two, and keep the best half (bone it if you like); cut
the meat from the other in uniform pieces, the size of an oyster;
put bits of butter, the size of a nutmeg, all over the best half of
the head; sprinkle pepper over it, and dredge on flour until it
looks white, then set it on <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
133]</span><a name='Page_133' id="Page_133"></a>a trivet or muffin
rings in a dripping-pan; put a cup of water into the pan, and set
it in a hot oven; turn it that it may brown evenly; baste once or
twice. Whilst this is doing, dip the prepared pieces of the head in
wheat flour or batter, and fry in hot lard or beef drippings a
delicate brown; season with pepper and salt and slices of lemon, if
liked. When the roast is done put it on a hot dish, lay the fried
pieces around it, and cover it with a tin cover; put the gravy from
the dripping-pan into the pan in which the pieces were fried, with
the slices of lemon, and a tablespoonful of browned flour, and, if
necessary, a little hot water. Let it boil up once, and strain it
into a gravy boat, and serve with the meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CALF'S HEAD CHEESE.</b></p>
<p>Boil a calf's head in water enough to cover it, until the meat
leaves the bones; then take it with a skimmer into a wooden bowl or
tray; take from it every particle of bone; chop it small; season
with pepper and salt, a heaping tablespoonful of salt and a
teaspoonful of pepper will be sufficient; if liked, add a
tablespoonful of finely chopped sweet herbs; lay in a cloth in a
colander, put the minced meat into it, then fold the cloth closely
over it, lay a plate over, and on it a gentle weight. When cold it
may be sliced thin for supper or sandwiches. Spread each slice with
made mustard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BRAIN CUTLETS.</b></p>
<p>Well wash the brains and soak them in cold water until white.
Parboil them until tender in a small saucepan for about a quarter
of an hour; then thoroughly drain them and place them on a board.
Divide them into small pieces with a knife. Dip each piece into
flour, and then roll them in egg and bread crumbs, and fry them in
butter or well-clarified drippings. Serve very hot with gravy.
Another way of doing brains is to prepare them as above, and then
stew them gently in rich stock, like stewed sweetbreads. They are
also nice plainly boiled and served with parsley and butter
sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CALFS HEAD BOILED.</b></p>
<p>Put the head into boiling water and let it remain about five
minutes; take it out, hold it by the ear, and with the back of the
knife scrape off the hair (should it not come off easily dip the
head again <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 134]</span><a name='Page_134'
id="Page_134"></a>in boiling water.) When perfectly clean take out
the eyes, cut off the ears and remove the brain, which soak for an
hour in warm water. Put the head to soak in hot water a few minutes
to make it look white, and then have ready a stewpan, into which
lay the head; cover it with cold water and bring it gradually to
boil. Remove the scum and add a little salt, which increases it and
causes it to rise to the top. Simmer it very gently from two and a
half to three hours, or until the bones will slip out easily, and
when nearly done, boil the brains fifteen or twenty minutes; skin
and chop them (not too finely), add a tablespoonful of minced
parsley which has been previously scalded; also a pinch of pepper,
salt; then stir into this four tablespoonfuls of melted butter; set
it on the back of the range to keep it hot. When the head is done,
take it up and drain very dry. Score the top and rub it over with
melted butter; dredge it with flour and set it in the oven to
brown.</p>
<p>When you serve the head, have it accompanied with a gravy boat
of melted butter and minced parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CALF'S LIVER AND BACON.</b></p>
<p>Slice the liver a quarter of an inch thick; pour hot water over
it and let it remain for a few minutes to clear it from blood; then
dry it in a cloth. Take a pound of bacon, or as much as you
require, and cut the same number of thin slices as you have of
liver; fry the bacon to a nice crisp; take it out and keep it hot;
then fry the liver in the same pan, having first seasoned it with
pepper and salt and dredged in a little flour; lay it in the hot
bacon fat and fry it a nice brown. Serve it with a slice of bacon
on the top of each slice of liver.</p>
<p>If you wish a gravy with it, pour off most of the fat from the
frying pan, put in about two ounces of butter, a tablespoonful of
flour well rubbed in, add a cup of water, salt and pepper, give it
one boil and serve in a gravy boat.</p>
<p><i>Another Way.</i>&mdash;Cut the liver in nice thin slices,
pour boiling water over it and let it stand about five minutes;
then drain and put in a dripping-pan with three or four thin slices
of salt pork or bacon; pepper and salt and put in the oven, letting
it cook until thoroughly done, then serve with a cream or milk
gravy poured over it.</p>
<p>Calf's liver and bacon are very good broiled after cutting each
in thin slices. Season with butter, pepper and salt.</p>

<p><b>CROQUETTES OF SWEETBREADS.</b></p>
<p>Take four veal sweetbreads, soak them for an hour in cold salted
water, first removing the pipes and membranes; then put them into
boiling salted water with a tablespoonful of vinegar, and cook them
twenty minutes, then drop them again into cold water to harden. Now
remove them, chop them very fine, almost to a paste. Season with
salt, pepper and a teaspoonful of grated onion; add the beaten
yolks of three raw eggs, one tablespoonful of butter, half a cupful
of cream, and sufficient fine cracker crumbs to make stiff enough
to roll out into little balls or cork-shaped croquettes. Have ready
a frying kettle half full of fat over the fire, a dish containing
three smoothly beaten eggs, a large platter of cracker dust; wet
the hands with cold water and make the mixture in shape; afterwards
rolling them in the cracker dust, then into the beaten egg, and
again in the cracker dust; smooth them on the outside and drop them
carefully in the hot fat. When the croquettes are fried a nice
golden brown, put them on a brown paper a moment to free them from
grease. Serve hot with sliced lemon or parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWEETBREADS.</b></p>
<p>There are two in a calf, which are considered delicacies. Select
the largest. The color should be clear and a shade darker than the
fat. Before cooking in any manner let them lie for half an hour in
tepid water; then throw into hot water to whiten and harden, after
which draw off the outer casing, remove the little pipes, and cut
into thin slices. They should always be thoroughly cooked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED SWEETBREADS.</b></p>
<p>After preparing them as above they are put into hot fat and
butter, and fried the same as lamb chops, also broiled the same,
first rolling them in egg and cracker crumbs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED SWEETBREADS.</b></p>
<p>Three sweetbreads, egg and bread crumbs, oiled butter, three
slices of toast, brown gravy.</p>
<p>Choose large, white sweetbreads, put them into warm water to
draw out the blood, and to improve their color; let them remain for
rather more than one hour; then put them into boiling water, and
allow them to simmer for about ten minutes which renders them firm.
Take <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 136]</span><a name='Page_136' id=
"Page_136"></a>them up, drain them, brush over the egg, sprinkle
with bread crumbs; dip them in egg again, and then into more bread
crumbs. Drop on them a little oiled butter, and put the sweetbreads
into a moderately heated oven, and let them bake for nearly
three-quarters of an hour. Make three pieces of toast; place the
sweetbreads on the toast, and pour round, but not over, them a good
brown gravy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRICASSEED SWEETBREADS.</b></p>
<p>If they are uncooked, cut into thin slices, let them simmer in a
rich gravy for three-quarters of an hour, add a well-beaten egg,
two tablespoonfuls of cream and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley;
stir all together for a few minutes and serve immediately.</p>

<br>
<h2>MUTTON AND LAMB.</h2>
<p><b>ROAST MUTTON.</b></p>
<p>The pieces mostly used for roasting are the hind-quarter of the
sheep, called the loin and leg, the fore-quarter, the shoulder,
also the chine or saddle, which is the two loins together. Every
part should be trimmed off that cannot be eaten; then wash well and
dry with a clean cloth; lay it in your dripping-pan and put in a
little water to baste it with at first; then afterward with its own
gravy. Allow, in roasting, about twelve minutes to the pound; that
is, if your fire is strong, which it should be. It should not be
salted at first, as that tends to harden it, and draws out too much
of the blood or juices; but salt soon after it begins to roast
well. If there is danger of its browning too fast, cover it with a
sheet of white paper. Baste it often, and about a quarter of an
hour before you think it will be done dredge the meat very lightly
with flour and baste it with butter. Skim the gravy well and
thicken very slightly with brown flour. Serve with currant jelly or
other tart sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BONED LEG OF MUTTON ROASTED.</b></p>
<p>Take the bone out of a small leg of mutton, without spoiling the
skin if possible, then cut off most of the fat. Fill the hole
whence the bone was taken with a stuffing made the same as for
fowls, adding to <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 137]</span><a name=
'Page_137' id="Page_137"></a>it part of an onion finely minced. Sew
the leg up underneath to prevent the dressing or stuffing from
falling out. Bind and tie it up compactly; put it in a roasting
pan, turn in a cup of hot water and place it in a moderately hot
oven, basting it occasionally. When partly cooked season with salt
and pepper. When thoroughly cooked, remove and place the leg on a
warm platter; skim the grease from the top of the drippings, add a
cup of water and thicken with a spoonful of dissolved flour. Send
the gravy to the table in a gravy dish, also a dish of currant
jelly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.</b></p>
<p>To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling, wash it clean, cut a
small piece off the shank bone, and trim the knuckle. Put it into a
pot with water enough to cover it, and boil gently from two to
three hours, skimming well. Then take it from the fire, and keeping
the pot well covered, let it finish by remaining in the steam for
ten or fifteen minutes. Serve it up with a sauce boat of melted
butter, into which a teacupful of capers or nasturtiums have been
stirred. If the broth is to be used for soup, put in a little salt
while boiling; if not, salt it well when partly done, and boil the
meat in a cloth.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON.</b></p>
<p>This recipe can be varied either by preparing the leg with a
stuffing, placed in the cavity after having the bone removed, or
cooking it without. Having lined the bottom of a thick iron kettle
or stewpan with a few thin slices of bacon, put over the bacon four
carrots, three onions, a bunch of savory herbs; then over these
place the leg of mutton. Cover the whole with a few more slices of
bacon, then pour over half a pint of water. Cover with a tight
cover and stew very gently for four hours, basting the leg
occasionally with its own liquor, and seasoning it with salt and
pepper as soon as it begins to be tender. When cooked strain the
gravy, thicken with a spoonful of flour (it should be quite brown),
pour some of it over the meat and send the remainder to the table
in a tureen, to be served with the mutton when carved. Garnish the
dish around the leg with potatoes cut in the shape of olives and
fried a light brown in butter.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 138]</span><a name='Page_138' id=
"Page_138"></a>
<p><b>LEG OF MUTTON &Aacute; LA VENISON.</b></p>
<p>Remove all the rough fat from the mutton and lay it in a deep
earthen dish; rub into it thoroughly the following: One
tablespoonful of salt, one each of celery-salt, brown sugar, black
pepper, English mustard, allspice, and some sweet herbs, all
powdered and mixed; after which pour over it slowly a teacup of
good vinegar, cover tightly, and set in a cool place four or five
days, turning it and basting often with the liquid each day. To
cook, put in a kettle a quart of boiling water, place over it an
inverted shallow pan, and on it lay the meat just as removed from
the pickle; cover the kettle tightly and stew for four hours. Do
not lat the water touch the meat. Add a cup of hot water to the
pickle remaining and baste with it. When done, thicken the liquid
with flour and strain through a fine sieve, to serve with the meat;
also a relish of currant jelly, the dame as for venison.</p>
<p>This is a fine dish when the directions are faithfully
followed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED LEG OF MUTTON.</b></p>
<p>Wash and put the leg in a steamer and cook it until tender, then
place in a roasting pan, salt and dredge well with flour and set it
in a hot oven until nicely browned; the water that remains in the
bottom of the steamer may be used for soup. Serve with currant
jelly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HASHED MUTTON.</b></p>
<p>Cut into small pieces the lean of some cold mutton that has been
underdone, and season it with pepper and salt. Take the bones and
other trimmings, put them in a sauce-pan with as much water as will
cover them, and some sliced onions, and let them stew till you have
drawn from them a good gravy. Having skimmed it well, strain the
gravy into a stew-pan, and put the mutton into it. Have
ready-boiled some carrots, turnips, potatoes and onions. Slice them
and add to the meat and gravy. Set the pan on the fire and let it
simmer till the meat is warmed through, but do not allow it to
boil, as it has been once cooked already. Cover the bottom of the
dish with slices of buttered toast. Lay the meat and vegetables
upon it, and pour over them the gravy.</p>
<p>Tomatoes will be found an improvement.</p>
<p>If green peas or Lima beans are in season, you may boil them and
put them to the hashed mutton, leaving out the other vegetables, or
serving them up separately.</p>
<br>

<p><b>BROILED MUTTON CHOPS.</b></p>
<p>Loin of mutton, pepper and salt, a small piece of butter. Cut
the chops from a tenderloin of mutton, remove a portion of the fat,
and trim them into a nice shape; slightly beat and level them;
place the gridiron over a bright clear fire, rub the bars with a
little fat, and lay on the chops. While broiling frequently turn
them, and in about eight minutes they will be done. Season with
pepper and salt, dish them on a very hot dish, rub a small piece of
butter on each chop, and serve very hot and expeditiously. Nice
with tomato sauce poured over them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED MUTTON CHOPS. NO. 1.</b></p>
<p>Put in a frying-pan a tablespoonful of cold lard and butter
mixed; have some fine mutton chops without much fat; trim off the
skin. Dip into wheat flour, or rolled cracker, and beaten egg, then
lay them into the hot grease, sprinkle with salt and pepper, fry on
both sides a fine brown. When dine, take them up and place on a hot
dish. If you wish a made gravy, turn off the superfluous grease, if
any. stir into the hot gravy remaining a heaping spoonful of cold
water or milk; season with pepper and salt, let it boil up thick.
You can serve it in a separate dish or pour it over the chops.
Tomato sauce is considered fine, turned over a dish of hot fried or
broiled chops.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED MUTTON CHOPS. NO. 2.</b></p>
<p>Prepare the chops by trimming off all extra fat and skin, season
them with salt and pepper; dip each chop in beaten egg, then in
rolled cracker or bread-crumbs; dip again in the egg and crumbs,
and so on until they are well coated with the crumb. Have ready a
deep spider containing a pound or more of lard, hot enough to fry
crullers. Drop into this hot lard the chops, frying only a few at a
time, as too many cool the fat. Fry them brown, and serve them up
hot and dry, on a warm platter.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 140]</span><a name='Page_140' id=
"Page_140"></a>
<p><b>MUTTON CUTLETS. (Baked.)</b></p>
<p>Prepare them the same as for frying, lay them in a dripping-pan
with a <i>very</i> little water at the bottom. Bake quickly, and
baste often with butter and water. Make a little brown gravy and
turn over them when they are served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED MUTTON CHOPS AND POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Wash and peel some good potatoes and cut them into slices the
thickness of a penny-piece. The quantity of potatoes must, of
course, be decided according to the number of persons to whom they
have to be served; but it is a safe plan to allow two, or even
three, potatoes for each person. After the potatoes are sliced,
wash them in two or three waters to thoroughly cleanse them, then
arrange them neatly (in layers) in a brown stone dish proper for
baking purposes. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper between each
layer, and add a sufficient quantity of cold water to prevent their
burning. Place the dish in a very hot oven&mdash;oil the top
shelf&mdash;so as to brown the potatoes in a few minutes. Have
ready some nice loin chops (say one&mdash;for each person); trim
off most of the fat; make them into a neat round shape by putting a
small skewer through each. When the potatoes are nicely browned,
remove the dish from the oven, and place the chops on the top. Add
a little more salt and pepper, and water if required, and return
the dish to a cooler part of the oven, where it may be allowed to
remain until sufficiently cooked, which will be in about
three-quarters of an hour. When the upper sides of the chops are a
nice crisp brown, turn them over so as to brown the other side
also. If, in the cooking, the potatoes appear to be getting too
dry, a little more water may be gently poured in at one corner of
the dish, only care must be taken to see that the water is hot this
time&mdash;not cold as at first. The dish in which the chops and
potatoes are baked must be as neat looking as possible, as it has
to be sent to the table; turning the potatoes out would, of course,
spoil their appearance. Those who have never tasted this dish have
no idea how delightful it is. While the chops are baking the gravy
drips from them among the potatoes, rendering the whole most
delicious.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUTTONETTES.</b></p>
<p>Cut from a leg of mutton slices about half an inch thick. On
each slice lay a spoonful of stuffing made with bread crumbs,
beaten <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 141]</span><a name='Page_141' id=
"Page_141"></a>egg, butter, salt, pepper, sage and summer savory.
Roll up the slices, pinning with little skewers or small wooden
toothpicks to keep the dressing in. Put a little butter and water
in a baking-pan with the muttonettes, and cook in hot oven
three-quarters of an hour. Baste often, and when done thicken the
gravy, pour over the meat, garnish with parsley, and serve on hot
platter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>IRISH STEW.</b></p>
<p>Time about two hours. Two and a half pounds of chops, eight
potatoes, four turnips, four small onions, nearly a quart of water.
Take some chops from loin of mutton, place them in stewpan in
alternate layers of sliced potatoes and chops; add turnips and
onions cut into pieces, pour in nearly a quart of cold water; cover
stewpan closely, let it stew gently till vegetables are ready to
mash and the greater part of the gravy is absorbed; then place in a
dish; serve it up hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUTTON PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Line a two-quart pudding basin with some beef suet paste; fill
the lining with thick mutton cutlets, slightly trimmed, or, if
preferred, with steaks cut from the leg; season with pepper and
salt some parsley, a little thyme and two slices of onion chopped
fine, and between each layer of meat, put some slices of potatoes.
When the pudding is filled, wet the edges of the paste around the
top of the basin, and cover with a piece of paste rolled out the
size of the basin. Fasten down the edge by bearing all around with
the thumb; and then with the thumb and forefinger twist the edges
of the paste over so as to give it a corded appearance. This
pudding can be set in a steamer and steamed, or boiled. The time
required for cooking is about three hours. When done, turn it out
carefully on a platter and serve with a rich gravy under it.</p>
<p>This is a very good recipe for cooking small birds.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCRAMBLED MUTTON.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of chopped cold mutton, two tablespoonfuls of hot
water, and a piece of butter as large as an English walnut. When
the meat is hot, break in three eggs, and constantly stir until the
eggs begin to stiffen. Season with pepper and salt.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 142]</span><a name='Page_142' id=
"Page_142"></a>
<p><b>SCALLOPED MUTTON AND TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Over the bottom of an earthen baking-dish place a layer of bread
crumbs, and over it alternate layers of cold roast mutton cut in
thin slices, and tomatoes peeled and sliced; season each with salt,
pepper and bits of butter, as laid in. The top layer should be of
tomatoes, spread over with bread crumbs. Bake three-quarters of an
hour, and serve immediately.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LAMB SWEETBREADS AND TOMATO SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Lamb sweetbreads are not always procurable, but a stroll through
the markets occasionally reveals a small lot of them, which can
invariably be had at a low price, owing to their excellence being
recognized by but few buyers. Wash them well in salted water and
parboil fifteen minutes; when cool, trim neatly and put them in a
pan with just butter enough to prevent their burning; toss them
about until a delicate color; season with salt and pepper and
serve, surrounded with tomato sauce. (See SAUCES.)</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST QUARTER OF LAMB.</b></p>
<p>Procure a nice hind-quarter, remove some of the fat that is
around the kidney, skewer the lower joint up to the fillet, place
it in a moderate oven, let it heat through slowly, then dredge it
with salt and flour; quicken the fire, put half a pint of water
into the dripping-pan, with a teaspoonful of salt. With this liquor
baste the meat occasionally; serve with lettuce, green peas and
mint sauce.</p>
<p>A quarter of lamb weighing seven or eight pounds will require
two hours to roast.</p>
<p>A breast of lamb roasted is very sweet and is considered by many
as preferable to hind-quarter. It requires nearly as long a time to
roast as the quarter, and should be served in the same manner.</p>
<p>Make the gravy from the drippings, thickened with flour.</p>
<p>The mint sauce is made as follows: Take fresh, young spearmint
leaves stripped from stems; wash and drain them or dry on a cloth,
chop very fine, put in a gravy tureen, and to three tablespoonfuls
of mint add two of finely powdered cut-loaf sugar; mix, and let it
stand a few minutes, then pour over it six tablespoonfuls good
cider or white-wine vinegar. The sauce should be made some time
before dinner, so that the flavor of the mint may be well
extracted.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 143]</span><a name='Page_143' id=
"Page_143"></a>
<p><b>TO BROIL THE FORE-QUARTER OF LAMB.</b></p>
<p>Take off the shoulder and lay it upon the gridiron with the
breast; cut in two parts, to facilitate its cooking; put a tin
sheet on top of the meat, and a weight upon that; turn the meat
around frequently to prevent its burning; turn over as soon as
cooked on one side; renew the coals occasionally, that all parts
may cook alike; when done, season with butter, pepper and
salt&mdash;exactly like beefsteak. It takes some time to broil it
well; but when done it will be found to be equal to broiled
chicken, the flavor being more delicate than when cooked otherwise.
Serve with cream sauce, made as follows: Heat a tablespoonful of
butter in a saucepan, add a teaspoonful of flour and stir until
perfectly smooth; then add, slowly stirring in, a cup of cold milk;
let it boil up once, and season to taste with salt and pepper and a
teaspoonful of finely chopped fresh parsley. Serve in a gravy boat,
all hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LAMB STEW.</b></p>
<p>Cut up the lamb into small pieces (after removing all the fat)
say about two inches square. Wash it well and put it over the fire,
with just enough cold water to cover it well, and let it heat
gradually. It should stew gently until it is partly done; then add
a few thin slices of salt pork, one or two onions sliced up fine,
some pepper and salt if needed, and two or three raw potatoes cut
up into inch pieces. Cover it closely and stew until the meat is
tender. Drop in a few made dumplings, made like short biscuit, cut
out <i>very</i> small. Cook fifteen minutes longer. Thicken the
gravy with a little flour moistened with milk. Serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESSED LAMB.</b></p>
<p>The meat, either shoulder or leg, should be put to boil in the
morning with water just enough to cover it; when tender, season
with salt and pepper, then keep it over the fire until <i>very</i>
tender and the juice nearly boiled out. Remove it from the
fire-place in a wooden chopping bowl, season more if necessary,
chop it up like hash. Place it in a bread-pan, press out all the
juice, and put it in a cool place to harden. The pressing is
generally done by placing a dish over the meat and putting a
flat-iron upon that. Nice cut up cold into thin slices, and the
broth left from the meat would make a nice soup served with it,
adding vegetables and spices.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 144]</span><a name='Page_144' id=
"Page_144"></a>
<p><b>CROQUETTES OF ODDS AND ENDS.</b></p>
<br>
<p>These are made of any scraps or bits of good food that happen to
be left from one or more meals, and in such small quantities that
they cannot be warmed up separately. As, for example, a couple of
spoonfuls of frizzled beef and cream, the lean meat of one mutton
chop, one spoonful of minced beef, two cold hard-boiled eggs, a
little cold chopped potato, a little mashed potato, a chick's leg,
all the gristle and hard outside taken from the meat. These things
well chopped and seasoned, mixed with one raw egg, a little flour
and butter, and boiling water; then made into round cakes, thick
like fish-balls and browned well with butter in a frying pan or on
a griddle.</p>
<p>Scraps of hash, cold rice, boiled oatmeal left from breakfast,
every kind of fresh meat, bits of salt tongue, bacon, pork or ham,
bits of poultry, and crumbs of bread may be used. They should be
put together with care, so as not to have them too dry to be
palatable, or too moist to cook in shape. Most housekeepers would
be surprised at the result, making an addition to the breakfast or
lunch table. Serve on small squares of buttered toast, and with
cold celery if in season.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PORK.</b></p>
<p>The best parts, and those usually used for roasting, are the
loin, the leg, the shoulder, the sparerib and chine. The hams,
shoulders and middlings are usually salted, pickled and smoked.
Pork requires more thorough cooking than most meats; if the least
underdone it is unwholesome.</p>
<p>To choose pork: If the rind is thick and tough, and cannot be
easily impressed with the finger, it is old; when fresh, it will
look cool and smooth, and only corn-fed pork is good; swill or
still-fed pork is unfit to cure. Fresh pork is in season from
October to April. When dressing or stuffing is used, there are more
or less herbs used for seasoning&mdash;sage, summer savory, thyme
and sweet marjoram; these can be found (in the dried, pulverized
form, put up in small, light packages) at most of the best
druggists; still those raised and gathered at home are considered
more fresh.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 145]</span><a name='Page_145' id=
"Page_145"></a>
<p><b>ROAST PIG.</b></p>
<p>Prepare your dressing as for DRESSING FOR FOWLS, adding half an
onion, chopped fine; set it inside. Take a young pig about six
weeks old, wash it thoroughly inside and outside; and in another
water put a teaspoonful of baking soda, and rinse out the inside
again; wipe it dry with a fresh towel, salt the inside and stuff it
with the prepared dressing; making it full and plump, giving it its
original size and shape. Sew it up, place it in a kneeling posture
in the dripping-pan, tying the legs in proper position. Pour a
little hot salted water into the dripping-pan, baste with butter
and water a few times as the pig warms, afterwards with gravy from
the dripping-pan. When it begins to smoke all over rub it often
with a rag dipped in melted butter. This will keep the skin from
cracking and it still will be crisp. It will take from two to three
hours to roast. Make the gravy by skimming off most of the grease;
stir into that remaining in the pan a good tablespoonful of flour,
turn in water to make it the right consistency, season with pepper
and let all boil up once. Strain, and if you like wine in it, add
half a glass; turn it into a gravy boat. Place the pig upon a
large, hot platter, surrounded with parsley or celery tops; place a
green wreath around the neck, and a sprig of celery in its mouth.
In carving, cut off its head first; split down the back, take off
its hams and shoulders, and separate the ribs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST LOIN OF PORK.</b></p>
<p>Score the skin in strips about a quarter of an inch apart; place
it in a dripping-pan with a <i>very little</i> water under it; cook
it moderately at first, as a high heat hardens the rind before the
meat is heated through. If it is very lean, it should be rubbed
with fresh lard or butter when put into the pan. A stuffing might
be made of bread crumbs, chopped sage and onions, pepper and salt,
and baked separately on a pie dish; this method is better than
putting it in the meat, as many persons have a great aversion to
its flavor. A loin weighing about six pounds will roast in two
hours; allow more time if it should be very fat. Make a gravy with
flour stirred into the pork drippings. Serve with apple sauce and
pickles.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST LEG OF PORK.</b></p>
<p>Choose a small leg of fine young pork; cut a slit in the knuckle
with a sharp knife, and fill the space with sage and onion chopped,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 146]</span><a name='Page_146' id=
"Page_146"></a>and a little pepper and salt. When half done, score
the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than the outer rind.
Apple sauce and potatoes should be served with it. The gravy is to
be made the same way as for beef roast, by turning off all the
superfluous fat and adding a spoonful of flour stirred with a
little water; add water to make the right consistency. Serve in a
gravy boat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED LEG OF PORK.</b></p>
<p>For boiling, choose a small, compact, well-filled leg, and rub
it well with salt; let it remain in pickle for a week or ten days,
turning and rubbing it every day. An hour before dressing it put it
into cold water for an hour, which improves the color. If the pork
is purchased ready salted, ascertain how long the meat has been in
pickle and soak it accordingly. Put it into a boiling-pot, with
sufficient cold water to cover it, let it gradually come to a boil,
and remove the scum as it rises. Simmer it very gently until
tender, and do not allow it to boil fast, or the knuckle will fall
to pieces before the middle of the leg is done. Carrots, turnips or
parsnips may be boiled with the pork, some of which should be laid
around the dish as a garnish.</p>
<p><i>Time.</i>&mdash;A leg of pork weighing eight pounds, three
hours after the water boils, and to be simmered very gently.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRESH PORK POT-PIE.</b></p>
<p>Boil a sparerib, after removing all the fat and cracking the
bones, until tender; remove the scum as it rises, and when tender
season with salt and pepper; half an hour before time for serving
the dinner thicken the gravy with a little flour. Have ready
another kettle, into which remove all the bones and most of the
gravy, leaving only sufficient to cover the pot half an inch above
the rim that rests on the stove; put in the crust, cover tight, and
boil steadily forty-five minutes. To prepare the crust, work into
light dough a <i>small</i> bit of butter, roll it out thin, cut it
in small, square cakes, and lay them on the moulding-board until
very light. No steam should possibly escape while the crust is
cooking, and by no means allow the pot to cease boiling.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROAST SPARERIB.</b></p>
<p>Trim off the rough ends neatly, crack the ribs across the
middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper, fold over, stuff
with turkey <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 147]</span><a name='Page_147'
id="Page_147"></a>dressing, sew up tightly, place in a dripping-pan
with a pint of water, baste frequently, turning over once so as to
bake both sides equally until a rich brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PORK TENDERLOINS.</b></p>
<p>The tenderloins are unlike any other part of the pork in flavor.
They may be either fried or broiled; the latter being drier,
require to be well-buttered before serving, which should be done on
a hot platter before the butter becomes oily. Fry them in a little
lard, turning them to have them cooked through; when done, remove,
and keep hot while making a gravy by dredging a little flour into
the hot fat; if not enough add a little butter or lard, stir until
browned, and add a little milk or cream, stir briskly, and pour
over the dish. A little Worcestershire sauce may be added to the
gravy if desired.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PORK CUTLETS.</b></p>
<p>Cut them from the leg, and remove the skin; trim them and beat
them, and sprinkle on salt and pepper. Prepare some beaten egg in a
pan, and on a flat dish a mixture of bread crumbs, minced onion and
sage. Put some lard or drippings into a frying pan over the fire,
and when it boils put in the cutlets, having dipped every one first
in the egg, and then in the seasoning. Fry them twenty or thirty
minutes, turning them often. After you have taken them out of the
frying pan, skim the gravy, dredge in a little flour, give it one
boil, and then pour it on the dish round the cutlets.</p>
<p>Have apple sauce to eat with them.</p>
<p>Pork cutlets prepared in this manner may be stewed instead of
being fried. Add to them a little water, and stew them slowly till
thoroughly done, keeping them closely covered, except when you
remove the lid to skim them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PORK CHOPS AND FRIED APPLES.</b></p>
<p>Season the chops with salt and pepper and a little powdered
sage; dip them into bread crumbs. Fry about twenty minutes or until
they are done. Put them on a hot dish; pour off part of the gravy
into another pan to make a gravy to serve with them, if you choose.
Then fry apples which you have sliced about two-thirds of an inch
thick, cutting them around the apple so that the core is in
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 148]</span><a name='Page_148' id=
"Page_148"></a>the centre of each piece; then cut out the core.
When they are browned on one side and partly cooked, turn them
carefully with a pancake turner, and finish cooking; dish around
the chops or on a separate dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED PORK CHOPS.</b></p>
<p>Fry them the same as mutton chops. If a sausage flavor is liked,
sprinkle over them a little powdered sage or summer savory, pepper
and salt, and if a gravy is liked, skim off some of the fat in the
pan and stir in a spoonful of flour; stir it until free from lumps,
then season with pepper and salt and turn in a pint of sweet milk.
Boil up and serve in a gravy boat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PORK PIE.</b></p>
<p>Make a good plain paste. Take from two and a half to three
pounds of the thick ends of a loin of pork, with very little fat on
it; cut into very thin slices three inches long by two inches wide;
put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish. Wash and chop finely a
handful of parsley, also an onion. Sprinkle a small portion of
these over the pork, and a little pepper and salt. Add another
layer of pork, and over that some more of the seasoning, only be
sparing of the nutmeg. Continue this till the dish is full. Now
pour into the dish a cupful of stock or water, and a spoonful or
two of catsup. Put a little paste around the edge of the dish; put
on the cover and place the pie in a rather hot oven. When the paste
has risen and begins to take color, place the pie at the bottom of
the oven, with some paper over it, as it will require to be baked
at least two hours. Some prefer to cook the meat until partly done,
before putting into the crust.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Palmer House, Chicago.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>PORK POT-PIE.</b></p>
<p>Take pieces of ribs of lean salt pork, also a slice or two of
the fat of salt pork; scald it well with hot water so as to wash
out the briny taste. Put it into a kettle and cover it with cold
water, enough for the required want. Cover it and boil an hour,
season with pepper; then add half a dozen potatoes cut into
quarters. When it all commences to boil again, drop in dumplings
made from this recipe:&mdash;</p>
<p>One pint of sour or buttermilk, two eggs, well beaten, a
teaspoonful of salt, a level teaspoonful of soda; dissolve in a
spoonful of water as much flour as will make a very stiff batter.
Drop this into the kettle or broth by spoonfuls, and cook forty
minutes, closely covered.</p>

<p><b>PORK AND BEANS. (Baked.)</b></p>
<p>Take two quarts of white beans, pick them over the night before,
put to soak in cold water; in the morning put them in fresh water
and let them scald, then turn off the water and put on more, hot;
put to cook with them a piece of salt pork, gashed, as much as
would make five or six slices; boil slowly till soft (not mashed),
then add a tablespoonful of molasses, half a teaspoonful of soda,
stir in well, put in a deep pan, and bake one hour and a half. If
you do not like to use pork, salt the beans when boiling, and add a
lump of butter when preparing them for the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOSTON PORK AND BEANS.</b></p>
<p>Pick over carefully a quart of small, white beans; let them soak
over night in cold water; in the morning wash and drain in another
water. Put on to boil in plenty of cold water with a piece of soda
the size of a bean; let them come to a boil, then drain again,
cover with water once more, and boil them fifteen minutes, or until
the skin of the beans will crack when taken out and blown upon.
Drain the beans again, put them into an earthen pot, adding a
tablespoonful of salt; cover with hot water, place in the centre a
pound of salt pork, first scalding it with hot water, and scoring
the rind across the top, a quarter of an inch apart to indicate
where the slices are to be cut. Place the pot in the oven, and bake
six hours or longer. Keep the oven a moderate heat; add hot water
from the tea-kettle as needed, on account of evaporation, to keep
the beans moist. When the meat becomes crisp and looks cooked,
remove it, as too long baking the pork destroys its solidity.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED SALT PORK.</b></p>
<p>Cut in thin slices, and freshen in cold water, roll in flour,
and fry crisp. If required quickly pour boiling water over the
slices, let stand a few minutes, drain and roll in flour as before;
drain off most of the grease from the frying pan; stir in while hot
one or two tablespoonfuls of flour, about half a pint of milk, a
little pepper, and salt if over freshened; let it boil, and pour
into a gravy dish. A teaspoonful of finely-chopped parsley will add
pleasantly to the appearance of the gravy.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]</span><a name='Page_150' id=
"Page_150"></a>
<p><b>GRILLED SALT PORK.</b></p>
<p>Take quite thin slices of the thick part of side pork, of a
clear white, and thinly streaked with lean; hold one on a toasting
fork before a brisk fire to grill; have at hand a dish of cold
water, in which immerse it frequently while cooking, to remove the
superfluous fat and render it more delicate. Put each slice as
cooked in a warm covered pan; when all are done, serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED HAM AND EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Cut slices of ham quite thin, cut off the rind or skin, put them
into a hot frying pan, turning them often until crisp, taking care
not to burn the slices; three minutes will cook them well. Dish
them on a hot platter; then turn off the top of the grease, rinse
out the pan, and put back the clear grease to fry the eggs. Break
the eggs separately in a saucer, that in case a bad one should be
among them it may not mix with the rest. Slip each egg gently into
the frying pan. Do not turn them while they are frying, put keep
pouring some of the hot lard over them with a kitchen spoon; this
will do them sufficiently on the upper side. They will be done
enough in about three minutes; the white must retain its
transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it. When done
take them up with a tin slice; drain off the lard, and if any part
of the white is discolored or ragged, trim it off. Lay a fried egg
upon each slice of the ham, and send to table hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD BACON AND EGGS.</b></p>
<p>An economical way of using bacon and eggs that have been left
from a previous meal is to put them in a wooden bowl and chop them
quite fine, adding a little mashed or cold chopped potato, and a
little bacon gravy, if any was left. Mix and mould it into little
balls, roll in raw egg and cracker crumbs, and fry in a spider the
same as frying eggs; fry a light brown on both sides. Serve hot.
Very appetizing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCRAPPEL.</b></p>
<p>Scrappel is a most palatable dish. Take the head, heart and any
lean scraps of pork, and boil until the flesh slips easily from the
bones. Remove the fat, gristle and bones, then chop fine. Set the
liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the cake
of fat from the surface and return to the fire. When it boils put
in the chopped <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 151]</span><a name=
'Page_151' id="Page_151"></a>meat and season well with pepper and
salt. Let it boil again, then thicken with corn meal as you would
in making ordinary corn meal mush, by letting it slip through the
fingers slowly to prevent lumps. Cook an hour, stirring constantly
at first, afterwards putting back on the range in a position to
boil gently. When done, pour into a long, square pan, not too deep,
and mould. In cold weather this can be kept several weeks. Cut into
slices when cold, and fried brown, as you do mush, is a cheap and
delicious breakfast dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BAKE A HAM. (Corned.)</b></p>
<p>Take a medium-sized ham and place it to soak for ten or twelve
hours. Then cut away the rusty part from underneath, wipe it dry,
and cover it rather thickly over with a paste made of flour and
water. Put it into an earthen dish, and set it in a moderately
heated oven. When done, take off the crust carefully, and peel off
the skin, put a frill of cut paper around the knuckle, and raspings
of bread over the fat of the ham, or serve it glazed and garnished
with cut vegetables. It will take about four or five hours to bake
it.</p>
<p>Cooked in this way the flavor is much finer than when
boiled.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PIGS' FEET PICKLED.</b></p>
<p>Take twelve pigs' feet, scrape and wash them clean, put them
into a saucepan with enough hot (not boiling) water to cover them.
When partly done, salt them. It requires four to five hours to boil
them soft. Pack them in a stone crock, and pour over them spiced
vinegar made hot. They will be ready to use in a day or two. If you
wish them for breakfast, split them, make a batter of two eggs, a
cup of milk, salt, a teaspoonful of butter, with flour enough to
make a thick batter; dip each piece in this and fry in hot lard.
Or, dip them in beaten egg and flour and fry. Souse is good eaten
cold or warm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED HAM.</b></p>
<p>First remove all dust and mold by wiping with a coarse cloth;
soak it for an hour in cold water, then wash it thoroughly. Cut
with a sharp knife the hardened surface from the base and butt of
the ham. Place it over the fire in <i>cold</i> water, and let it
come to a moderate boil, keeping it steadily at this point,
allowing it to cook twenty minutes for every pound of meat. A ham
weighing twelve pounds will require <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
152]</span><a name='Page_152' id="Page_152"></a>four hours to cook
properly, as underdone ham is very unwholesome. When the ham is to
be served hot, remove the skin by pealing it off, place it on a
platter, the fat side up, and dot the surface with spots of black
pepper. Stick in also some whole cloves.</p>
<p>If the ham is to be served cold, allow it to remain in the pot
until the water in which it was cooked becomes cold. This makes it
more juicy. Serve it in the same manner as when served hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROILED HAM.</b></p>
<p>Cut your ham into thin slices, which should be a little less
than one quarter of an inch thick. Trim very closely the skin from
the upper side of each slice, and also trim off the outer edge
where the smoke has hardened the meat. If the ham is very salt lay
it in <i>cold</i> water for one hour before cooking, then wipe with
a dry cloth. Never soak ham in tepid or hot water, as it will
toughen the meat.</p>
<p>Broil over a brisk fire, turning the slices constantly. It will
require about five minutes, and should be served the last thing
directly from the gridiron, placed on a warm platter, with a little
butter and a sprinkle of pepper on the top of each slice. If ham or
bacon is allowed to stand by the fire after it has been broiled or
fried, it will speedily toughen, loosing all its grateful
juices.</p>
<p>Cold boiled ham is very nice for broiling, and many prefer it to
using the raw ham.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTTED HAM.</b></p>
<p>To TWO pounds of lean ham allow one pound of fat, two
teaspoonfuls of powdered mace, half a nutmeg, grated, rather more
than half a teaspoonful of cayenne.</p>
<p><i>Mode.</i>&mdash;Mince the ham, fat and lean together, in the
above proportion, and pound it well in a mortar, seasoning it with
cayenne pepper, pounded mace and nutmeg; put the mixture into a
deep baking-dish, and bake for half an hour; then press it well
into a stone jar, fill up the jar with clarified lard, cover it
closely, and paste over it a piece of thick paper. If well
seasoned, it will keep a long time in winter, and will be found
very convenient for sandwiches, etc.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOLOGNA SAUSAGE. (Cooked.)</b></p>
<p>Two POUNDS of lean pork, two pounds of lean veal, two pounds of
fresh lean beef, two pounds of fat salt pork, one pound of beef
suet, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 153]</span><a name='Page_153' id=
"Page_153"></a>ten tablespoonfuls of powdered sage, one ounce each
of parsley, savory, marjoram and thyme mixed. Two teaspoonfuls of
cayenne pepper, the same of black, one grated nutmeg, one
teaspoonful of cloves, one minced onion, salt to taste. Chop or
grind the meat and suet; season, and stuff into beef skins; tie
these up, prick each in several places to allow the escape of
steam; put into hot, not boiling, water, and heat gradually to the
boiling point. Cook slowly for one hour; take out the skins and lay
them to dry in the sun, upon clean sweet straw or hay. Rub the
outside of the skins with oil or melted butter, and place in a
cool, dry cellar. If you wish to keep them more than a week, rub
ginger or pepper on the outside, then wash it off before using.
This is eaten without further cooking. Cut in round slices and lay
sliced lemons around the edge of the dish, as many like to squeeze
a few drops upon the sausage before eating. These are very nice
smoked like hams.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COUNTRY PORK SAUSAGES.</b></p>
<p>Six pounds lean fresh pork, three pounds of chine fat, three
tablespoonfuls of salt, two of black pepper, four tablespoonfuls of
pounded and sifted sage, two of summer savory. Chop the lean and
fat pork finely, mix the seasoning in with your hands, taste to see
that it has the right flavor, then put them into cases, either the
cleaned intestines of the hog, or make long, narrow bags of stout
muslin, large enough to contain each enough sausage for a family
dish. Fill these with the meat, dip in melted lard, and hang them
in a cool, dry, dark place. Some prefer to pack the meat in jars,
pouring melted lard over it, covering the top, to be taken out as
wanted and made into small round cakes with the hands, then fried
brown. Many like spices added to the seasoning&mdash;cloves, mace
and nutmeg. This is a matter of taste.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Marion Harland.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>TO FRY SAUSAGES.</b></p>
<p>Put a small piece of lard or butter into the frying pan. Prick
the sausages with a fork, lay them in the melted grease, keep
moving them about, turning them frequently to prevent bursting; in
ten or twelve minutes they will be sufficiently browned and cooked.
Another sure way to prevent the cases from bursting is to cover
them with cold water and let it come to the boiling point; turn off
the water and fry them. Sausages are nicely cooked by putting them
in a baking-pan them in the oven, turning them once or twice. In
this <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 154]</span><a name='Page_154' id=
"Page_154"></a>way you avoid all smoke and disagreeable odor. A
pound will cook brown in ten minutes in a hot oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HEAD CHEESE.</b></p>
<p>Boil the forehead, ears and feet, and nice scraps trimmed from
the hams of a fresh pig, until the meat will almost drop from the
bones. Then separate the meat from the bones, put in a large
chopping-bowl, and season with pepper, salt, sage and summer
savory. Chop it rather coarsely; put it back in the same kettle it
was boiled in, with just enough of the liquor in which it was
boiled to prevent its burning; warm it through thoroughly, mixing
it well together. Now pour it into a strong muslin bag, press the
bag between two flat surfaces, with a heavy weight on top; when
cold and solid it can be cut in slices. Good cold, or warmed up in
vinegar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CURE HAMS AND BACON. (A Prize Recipe.)</b></p>
<p>For each hundred pounds of hams, make a pickle of ten pounds of
salt, two pounds of brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, one ounce
of red pepper, and from four to four and a half gallons of water,
or just enough to cover the hams, after being packed in a
water-tight vessel, or enough salt to make a brine to float a fresh
egg high enough, that is to say, out of water. First rub the hams
with common salt and lay them into a tub. Take the above
ingredients, put them into a vessel over the fire, and heat it hot,
stirring it frequently; remove all the scum, allow it to boil ten
minutes, let it cool and pour over the meat. After laying in this
brine five or six weeks, take out, drain and wipe, and smoke from
two to three weeks. Small pieces of bacon may remain in this pickle
two weeks, which would be sufficient.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO SMOKE HAMS AND FISH AT HOME.</b></p>
<p>Take an old hogshead, stop up all the crevices, and fix a place
to put a cross-stick near the bottom, to hang the article to be
smoked on. Next, in the side, cut a hole near the top, to introduce
an iron pan filled with hickory wood sawdust and small pieces of
green wood. Having turned the hogshead upside down, hang the
articles upon the cross-stick, introduce the iron pan in the
opening, and place a piece of red-hot iron in the pan, cover it
with sawdust, and all will be complete. Let a large ham remain ten
days, and keep up a good smoke. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
155]</span><a name='Page_155' id="Page_155"></a>The best way for
keeping hams is to sew them in coarse cloths, white-washed on the
outside.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CURE ENGLISH BACON.</b></p>
<p>This process is called the "dry cure," and is considered far
preferable to the New England or Yankee style of putting prepared
brine or pickle over the meat. First the hog should not be too
large or too fat, weighing not over two hundred pounds, then after
it is dressed and cooled cut it up into proper pieces; allow to
every hundred pounds a mixture of four quarts of common salt, one
quarter of a pound of saltpetre and four pounds of sugar. Rub this
preparation thoroughly over and into each piece, then place them
into a tight tub or suitable cask; there will a brine form of
itself from the juices of the meat, enough at least to baste it
with, which should be done two or three times a week; turning each
piece every time.</p>
<p>In smoking this bacon, the sweetest flavor is derived from black
birch chips, but if these are not to be had, the next best wood is
hickory; the smoking with corn-cobs imparts a rank flavor to this
bacon, which is very distasteful to English people visiting this
country. It requires three weeks or a month to smoke this bacon
properly.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Berkshire Recipe.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>TO TRY OUT LARD.</b></p>
<p>Skin the leaf lard carefully, cut it into small pieces, and put
it into a kettle or saucepan; pour in a cupful of water to prevent
burning; set it over the fire where it will melt slowly. Stir it
frequently and let it simmer until nothing remains but brown
scraps. Remove the scraps with a perforated skimmer, throw in a
little salt to settle the fat, and, when clear, strain through a
coarse cloth into jars. Remember to watch it constantly, stirring
it from the bottom until the salt is thrown in to settle it; then
set it back on the range until clear. If it scorches it gives it a
very bad flavor.</p>

<h2><b>SAUCES AND DRESSINGS.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>DRAWN BUTTER.</b></p>
<p>Melted butter is the foundation of most of the common sauces.
Have a covered saucepan for this purpose. One lined with porcelain
will be best. Take a quarter of a pound of the best fresh butter,
cut it up, and mix with it about one tablespoonful of flour. When
it is thoroughly mixed, put it into the saucepan, and add to it
half a teacupful of hot water. Cover the saucepan and set it in a
large tin pan of boiling water. Shake it round continually (always
moving it the same way) till it is entirely melted and begins to
simmer. Then let it rest till it boils up.</p>
<p>If you set it on too hot a fire it will be oily.</p>
<p>If the butter and flour are not well mixed, it will be
lumpy.</p>
<p>If you put in too much water, it will be thin and poor. All
these defects are to be carefully avoided.</p>
<p>In melting butter for sweet or pudding sauce, you may use milk
instead of water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TARTARE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>The raw yolks of two eggs, half a teacupful of pure olive oil,
three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one of made mustard, one
teaspoonful of sugar, a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, one
teaspoonful of salt, one of onion juice, one tablespoonful of
chopped capers, one of chopped cucumber pickle. Put together the
same as mayonnaise dressing, adding the chopped ingredients the
last thing.</p>
<p>This sauce is good for fried or boiled fish, boiled tongue, fish
salad, and may be used with fried and broiled meats.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGG SAUCE, OR WHITE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Mix two tablespoonfuls of sifted flour with half a teacup of
warm butter. Place over the fire a saucepan containing a pint of
sweet milk and a saltspoon of salt, and a dash of white pepper;
when it <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 157]</span><a name='Page_157' id=
"Page_157"></a>reaches the boiling point, add the butter and flour,
stirring briskly until it thickens and becomes like cream. Have
ready three cold hard-boiled eggs, sliced and chopped, add them to
the sauce; let them heat through thoroughly, and serve in a boat.
If you have plenty of cream, use it and omit the butter. By
omitting the eggs, you have the same as "White Sauce."</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Take a pint of oysters and heat them in their own liquor long
enough to come to a boil, or until they begin to ruffle. Skim out
the oysters into a warm dish, put into the liquor a teacup of milk
or cream, two tablespoonfuls of cold butter, a pinch of cayenne and
salt; thicken with a tablespoonful of flour stirred to a paste,
boil up and then add the oysters.</p>
<p>Oyster sauce is used for fish, boiled turkey, chickens and
boiled white meats of most kinds.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LOBSTER SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Put the coral and spawn of a boiled lobster into a mortar with a
tablespoonful of butter; pound it to a smooth mass, then rub it
through a sieve; melt nearly a quarter of a pound of sweet butter,
with a wine-glass of water or vinegar; add a teaspoonful of made
mustard, stir in the coral and spawn, and a little salt and pepper;
stir it until it is smooth and serve. Some of the meat of the
lobster may be chopped fine and stirred into it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SAUCE FOR SALMON AND OTHER FISH.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of milk heated to a boil and thickened with a
tablespoonful of cornstarch previously wet up with cold water, the
liquor from the salmon, one great spoonful of butter, one raw egg
beaten light, the juice of half a lemon, mace and cayenne pepper to
taste. Add the egg to thickened milk when you have stirred in the
butter and liquor; take from the fire, season and let it stand in
hot water three minutes, covered. Lastly put in lemon juice and
turn out immediately. Pour it all over and around the salmon.</p>

'Page_158' id="Page_158"></a>flour wet up with cold water; as it
thickens, the chopped yolk of one boiled egg, and one raw egg
beaten light. Take directly from the fire, season with pepper,
salt, a little chopped parsley and the juice of one lemon, and set
covered in boiling water (but not over fire) five minutes, stirring
occasionally. Pour part of the sauce over fish when dished; the
rest in a boat. Serve mashed potatoes with it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH SAUCE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Make a pint of drawn butter, add one tablespoonful of pepper
sauce or Worcestershire sauce, a little salt and six hard-boiled
eggs chopped fine. Pour over boiled fish and garnish with sliced
lemon.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH SAUCE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Half a cupful of melted butter, half a cupful of vinegar, two
tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, salt, and a tablespoonful of made
mustard. Boil ten minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CELERY SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Mix two tablespoonfuls of flour with half a teacupful of butter;
have ready a pint of boiling milk; stir the flour and butter into
the milk; take three heads of celery, cut into small bits, and boil
for a few minutes in water, which strain off; put the celery into
the melted butter, and keep it stirred over the fire for five or
ten minutes. This is very nice with boiled fowl or turkey. Another
way to make celery sauce is: Boil a head of celery until quite
tender, then put it through a sieve; put the yolk of an egg in a
basin, and beat it well with the strained juice of a lemon; add the
celery and a couple of spoonfuls of liquor in which the turkey was
boiled; salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CAPER SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Chop the capers a very little, unless quite small; make half a
pint of drawn butter, to which add the capers, with a large
spoonful of the juice from the bottle in which they are sold; let
it just simmer and serve in a tureen. Nasturtiums much resemble
capers in taste, though larger, and may be used, and, in fact, are
preferred by many. They are grown on a climbing vine, and are
cultivated for their blossom and for pickling. When used as capers
they should be chopped <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
159]</span><a name='Page_159' id="Page_159"></a>more. If neither
capers nor nasturtiums are at hand, some pickles chopped up form a
very good substitute in the sauce.</p>

<br>
<p><b>BREAD SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>One cup of stale bread crumbs, one onion, two ounces of butter,
pepper and salt, a little mace. Cut the onion fine, and boil it in
milk till quite soft; then strain the milk on to the stale bread
crumbs, and let it stand an hour. Put it in a saucepan with the
boiled onion, pepper, salt and mace. Give it a boil, and serve in
sauce tureen. This sauce can also be used for grouse, and is very
nice. Roast partridges are nice served with bread crumbs, fried
brown in butter, with cranberry or currant jelly laid beside them
in the platter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Take a quart can of tomatoes, put it over the fire in a stewpan,
put in one slice of onion and two cloves, a little pepper and salt;
boil about twenty minutes; then remove from the fire and strain it
through a sieve. Now melt in another pan an ounce of butter, and as
it melts, sprinkle in a tablespoonful of flour; stir it until it
browns and froths a little. Mix the tomato pulp with it, and it is
ready for the table.</p>
<p>Excellent for mutton, chops, roast beef, etc.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ONION SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Work together until light a heaping tablespoonful of flour and
half a cupful of butter, and gradually add two cups of boiling
milk; stir constantly until it come to a boil; then stir into that

pepper to taste. Serve with boiled veal, poultry of mutton.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHILI SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Boil together two dozen ripe tomatoes, three small green
peppers, or a half teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one onion cut
fine, half a cup of sugar. Boil until thick; then add two cups of
vinegar; then strain the whole, set back on the fire and add a
tablespoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful each of ginger, allspice,
cloves and cinnamon; boil all five minutes, remove and seal in
glass bottles. This is very nice.</p>

<p><b>MINT SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Take fresh young spearmint leaves stripped from the stems; wash
and drain them, or dry on a cloth. Chop very fine, put in a gravy
boat, and to three tablespoonfuls of mint put two of white sugar;
mix and let it stand a few minutes, then pour over it six
tablespoonfuls of good cider or white-wine vinegar. The sauce
should be made some time before it is to be used, so that the
flavor of the mint may be well extracted. Fine with roast lamb.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SHARP BROWN SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Put in a saucepan one tablespoonful of chopped onion, three
tablespoonfuls of good cider vinegar, six tablespoonfuls of water,
three of tomato catsup, a little pepper and salt, half a cup of
melted butter, in which stir a tablespoonful of sifted flour; put

sprigs of parsley, two of thyme, a bay leaf and half a dozen
mushrooms cut up. Moisten the whole with a pint of stock or water
and a cup of sweet cream. Set it on the stove and cook slowly for
half an hour, watching closely that it does not burn; then strain
through a sieve. Most excellent with roast veal, meats and
fish.</p>

<p><b>MAITRE D'HOTEL SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Make a teacupful of drawn butter; add to it the juice of a
lemon, two tablespoonfuls of minced onion, three tablespoonfuls of
chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of powdered thyme or summer savory,
a pinch of cayenne and salt. Simmer over the fire and stir well.
Excellent with all kinds of fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WINE SAUCE FOR GAME.</b></p>
<p>Half a glass of currant jelly, half a glass of port wine, half a
glass of water, a tablespoonful of cold butter, a teaspoonful of
salt, the juice of half a lemon, a pinch of cayenne pepper and
three cloves. Simmer all together a few minutes, adding the wine
after it is <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 161]</span><a name='Page_161'
id="Page_161"></a>strained. A few spoonfuls of the gravy from the
game may be added to it. This sauce is especially nice with
venison.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Taber House, Denver.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Half a teacupful of butter, the juice of half a lemon, the yolk
of two eggs, a speck of cayenne pepper, half a cupful of boiling
water, half a teaspoonful of salt; beat the butter to a cream, add
the yolks of eggs one by one; then the lemon juice, pepper and
salt, beating all thoroughly; place the bowl in which is the
mixture in a saucepan of boiling water; beat with an egg-beater
until it begins to thicken which will be in about a minute; then
add the boiling water, beating all the time; stir until it begins
to thicken like soft custard; stir a few minutes after taking from
the fire; be careful not to cook it too long. This is very nice
with baked fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRANT JELLY SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Three tablespoonfuls of butter, one onion, one bay leaf, one
sprig of celery, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, half a cupful of
currant jelly, one tablespoonful of flour, one pint of stock, salt,
pepper. Cook the butter and onion until the latter begins to color.
Add the flour and herbs. Stir until brown; add the stock, and
simmer twenty minutes. Strain and skim off all the fat. Add the
jelly and stir over the fire until it is melted. Serve with
game.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROWN SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Delicious sauce for meats is made in this way: Slice a large
onion and fry in butter till it is brown; then cover the onion with
rich brown gravy, which is left from roast beef; add mustard, salt
and pepper, and if you choose a tablespoonful of Worcestershire
sauce; let this boil up, and if too thick, thin it with a little
stock or gravy, or even a little hot water with butter. Pour this
when done through a fine sieve. Of course a larger quantity can be
prepared at once than is mentioned here.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUSHROOM SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Wash a pint of small button mushrooms, remove the stems and
outside skins, stew them slowly in veal gravy or milk or cream,
adding an onion, and seasoning with pepper, salt and a little
butter rolled in <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 162]</span><a name=
'Page_162' id="Page_162"></a>flour. Their flavor will be heightened
by salting a few the night before, to extract the juice. In
dressing mushrooms only those of a dull pearl color on the outside
and the under part tinged with pale pink should be selected. If
there is a poisonous one among them, the onion in the sauce will
turn black. In such a case throw the whole away. Used for poultry,
beef or fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>When you wish to serve apple sauce with meat prepare it in this
way: Cook the apples until they are very tender, then stir them
thoroughly so there will be no lumps at all; add the sugar and a
little gelatine dissolved in warm water, a tablespoonful in a pint
of sauce; pour the sauce into bowls, and when cold it will be stiff
like jelly, and can be turned out on a plate. Cranberry sauce can
be treated in the same way. Many prefer this to plain stewing.</p>
<p>Apples cooked in the following way look very pretty on a
tea-table, and are appreciated by the palate. Select firm, round
greenings; pare neatly and cut in halves; place in a shallow
stewpan with sufficient boiling water to cover them, and a cupful
of sugar to every six apples. Each half should cook on the bottom
of the pan, and be removed from the others so as not to injure its
shape. Stew slowly until the pieces are very tender; remove to a
dish carefully; boil the syrup half an hour longer; pour it over
the apples and eat cold. A few pieces of lemon boiled in the syrup
adds to the flavor. These sauces are a fine accompaniment to roast
pork or roast goose.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CIDER APPLE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Boil four quarts of new cider until it is reduced to two quarts;
then put into it enough pared and quartered apples to fill the
kettle; let the whole stew over a moderate fire four hours; add
cinnamon if liked. This sauce is very fine with almost any kind of
meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OLD-FASHIONED APPLE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Pare and chop a dozen medium-sized apples, put them in a deep
pudding-dish; sprinkle over them a heaping coffeecupful of sugar
and one of water. Place them in the oven and bake slowly two hours
or more, or until they are a deep red brown; quite as nice as
preserves.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 163]</span><a name='Page_163' id=
"Page_163"></a>
<p><b>CRANBERRY SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>One quart of cranberries, two cupfuls of sugar and a pint of
water. Wash the cranberries, then put them on the fire with the
water, but in a covered saucepan. Let them simmer until each
cranberry bursts open; then remove the cover of the saucepan, add
the sugar and let them all boil twenty minutes without the cover.
The cranberries must never be stirred from the time they are placed
on the fire. This is an unfailing recipe for a most delicious
preparation of cranberries. Very fine with turkey and game.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Apple omelet, to be served with broiled sparerib or roast pork,
is very delicate. Take nine large, tart apples, four, eggs, one cup
of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter; add cinnamon or other spices
to suit your taste; stew the apples till they are very soft; mash
them so that there will be no lumps; add the butter and sugar while
they are still warm; but let them cool before putting in the beaten
eggs; bake this till it is brown; you may put it all in a shallow
pudding-dish or in two tin plates to bake. Very good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLAVORED VINEGARS.</b></p>
<p>Almost all the flavorings used for meats and salads may be
prepared in vinegar with little trouble and expense, and will be
found useful to impart an acid to flavors when lemons are not at
hand.</p>
<p>Tarragon, sweet basil, burnet, green mint, sage, thyme, sweet
marjoram, etc., may be prepared by putting three ounces of either
of these herbs, when in blossom, into one gallon of sharp vinegar,
let stand ten days, strain off clear, and bottle for use.</p>
<p>Celery and cayenne may be prepared, using three ounces of the
seed as above.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUCUMBER VINEGAR.</b></p>
<p><i>Ingredients</i>.&mdash;Ten large cucumbers, or twelve smaller
ones, one quart of vinegar, two onions, two shallots, one
tablespoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of pepper, a quarter of a
teaspoonful of cayenne.</p>
<p><i>Mode</i>.&mdash;Pare and slice the cucumbers, put them in a
stone jar, or wide-mouthed bottle, with the vinegar; slice the
onions and shallots, and add them, with all the other ingredients,
to the cucumbers. Let it stand four or five days; boil it all up,
and when cold, strain the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
164]</span><a name='Page_164' id="Page_164"></a>liquor through a
piece of muslin, and store it away in small bottles well sealed.
This vinegar is a very nice addition to gravies, hashes, etc., as
well as a great improvement to salads, or to eat with cold
meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRY POWDER.</b></p>
<p>To make curry powder, take one ounce of ginger, one ounce of
mustard, one ounce of pepper, three ounces of coriander seed, three
ounces of turmeric, half an ounce of cardamoms, one-quarter ounce
of cayenne pepper, one-quarter ounce of cinnamon, and one-quarter
ounce of cumin seed. Pound all these ingredients very fine in a
mortar; sift them and cork tight in a bottle.</p>
<p>This can be had ready prepared at most druggists, and it is much
less trouble to purchase it than to make it at home.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRY SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>One tablespoonful of butter, one of flour, one teaspoonful of
curry powder, one large slice of onion, one large cupful of stock,
salt and pepper to taste. Cut the onion fine, and fry brown in the
butter. Add the flour and curry powder. Stir for one minute, add
the stock and season with the salt and pepper. Simmer five minutes;
then strain and serve. This sauce can be served with a broil or
<i>saut&eacute;</i> of meat or fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BROWN BUTTER.</b></p>
<p>Put a lump of butter into a hot frying pan and toss it about
until it browns. Stir brown flour into it until it is smooth and
begins to boil. Use it for coloring gravies, and sauces for
meats.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BROWN FLOUR.</b></p>
<p>Spread flour upon a tin pie-plate, set it upon the stove or in a
<i>very</i> hot oven, and stir continually, after it begins to
color, until it is brown all through.</p>
<p>Keep it always on hand; put away in glass jars covered closely.
It is excellent for coloring and thickening many dishes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE MUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Boil some vinegar; take four spoonfuls of mustard, half of a
teaspoonful of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of
melted butter; mix well.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 165]</span><a name='Page_165' id=
"Page_165"></a>
<p><b>FRENCH MUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Three tablespoonfuls of mustard, one tablespoonful of granulated
sugar, well worked together, then beat in an egg until it is
smooth; add one teacupful of vinegar, a little at a time, working
it all smooth; then set on the stove and cook three or four
minutes, stirring all the time; when cool, add one tablespoonful of
the best olive oil, taking care to get it all thoroughly worked in
and smooth. You will find this very nice.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Mrs. D. Riegel.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>KITCHEN PEPPER.</b></p>
<p>Mix one ounce of ground ginger, half an ounce each of black
pepper, ground cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, one teaspoonful of
ground cloves, and six ounces of salt. Keep in a tightly corked
bottle.</p>
<div class='right'><i>The Caterer.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>PREPARED COCOANUT. (For Pies, Puddings, etc.)</b></p>
<p>To prepare cocoanut for future use, first cut a hole through the
meat at one of the holes in the end, draw off the milk, then loosen
the meat by pounding the nut well on all sides. Crack the nut and
take out the meat, and place the pieces of meat in a cool open oven
over night, or for a few hours, to dry; then grate it. If there is
more grated than is needed for present use, sprinkle it with sugar,
and spread out in a cool dry place. When dry enough put away in dry
cans or bottles. Will keep for weeks.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPICES.</b></p>
<p>Ginger is the root of a shrub first known in Asia, and now
cultivated in the West Indies and Sierra Leone. The stem grows
three or four feet high and dies every year. There are two
varieties of ginger&mdash;the white and black&mdash;caused by
taking more or less care in selecting and preparing the roots,
which are always dug in winter, when the stems are withered. The
white is the best.</p>
<p><i>Cinnamon</i> is the inner bark of a beautiful tree, a native
of Ceylon, that grows from twenty to thirty feet in height and
lives to be centuries old.</p>
<p><i>Cloves</i>.&mdash;Native to the Molucca Islands, and so
called from resemblance to a nail (<i>clavis</i>). The East Indians
call them "changkek" from the Chinese "techengkia" (fragrant
nails). They grow on a straight, smooth-barked tree, about forty
feet high. Cloves are not fruits, but blossoms, gathered before
they are quite unfolded.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 166]</span><a name='Page_166' id=
"Page_166"></a>
<p><i>Allspice</i>.&mdash;A berry so called because it combines the
flavor of several spices&mdash;grows abundantly on the allspice or
bayberry tree; native of South America and the West Indies. A
single tree has been known to produce one hundred and fifty pounds
of berries. They are purple when ripe.</p>
<p><i>Black pepper</i> is made by grinding the dried berry of a
climbing vine, native to the East Indies. White pepper is obtained
from the same berries, freed from their husk or rind. Red or
cayenne pepper is obtained by grinding the scarlet pod or
seed-vessel of a tropical plant that is now cultivated in all parts
of the world.</p>
<p><i>Nutmeg</i> is the kernel of a small, smooth, pear-shaped
fruit that grows on a tree in the Molucca Islands, and other parts
of the East. The trees commence bearing in the seventh year, and
continue fruitful until they are seventy or eighty years old.
Around the nutmeg or kernel is a bright, brown shell. This shell
has a soft, scarlet covering, which, when flattened out and dried,
is known as mace. The best nutmegs are solid, and emit oil when
pricked with a pin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HERBS FOR WINTER.</b></p>
<p>To prepare herbs for winter use, such as sage, summer savory,
thyme, mint or any of the sweet herbs, they should be gathered
fresh in their season, or procure them from the market. Examine
them well, throwing out all poor sprigs; then wash and shake them;
tie into small bundles, and tie over the bundles a piece of netting
or old lace (to keep off the dust); hang up in a warm, dry place,
the leaves downward. In a few days the herb will be thoroughly dry
and brittle. Or you may place them in a cool oven and let them
remain in it until perfectly dry. Then pick off all the leaves and
the tender tops of the stems; put them in a clean, large-mouthed
bottle that is perfectly dry. When wanted for use, rub fine, and
sift through a sieve. It is much better to put them in bottles as
soon as dried, as long exposure to the air causes them to lose
strength and flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MEATS AND THEIR ACCOMPANIMENTS.</b></p>
<p>With roast beef: tomato sauce, grated horse-radish, mustard,
cranberry sauce, pickles.</p>
<p>With roast pork: apple sauce, cranberry sauce.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 167]</span><a name='Page_167' id=
"Page_167"></a>
<p>With roast veal: tomato sauce, mushroom sauce, onion sauce and
cranberry sauce. Horse-radish and lemons are good.</p>
<p>With roast mutton: currant jelly, caper sauce.</p>
<p>With boiled mutton: onion sauce, caper sauce.</p>
<p>With boiled fowls: bread sauce, onion sauce, lemon sauce,
cranberry sauce, jellies. Also cream sauce. With roast lamb: mint
sauce.</p>
<p>With roast turkey: cranberry sauce, currant jelly. With boiled
turkey: oyster sauce.</p>
<p>With venison or wild ducks: cranberry sauce, currant jelly, or
currant jelly warmed with port wine.</p>
<p>With roast goose: apple sauce, cranberry sauce, grape or currant
jelly.</p>
<p>With boiled fresh mackerel: stewed gooseberries.</p>
<p>With boiled blue fish: white cream sauce, lemon sauce.</p>
<p>With broiled shad: mushroom sauce, parsley or egg sauce.</p>
<p>With fresh salmon: green peas, cream sauce.</p>
<p>Pickles are good with all roast meats, and in fact are suitable
accompaniments to all kinds of meats in general.</p>
<p>Spinach is the proper accompaniment to veal; green peas to lamb.
Lemon juice makes a very grateful addition to nearly all the
insipid members of the fish kingdom. Slices of lemon cut into very
small dice and stirred into drawn butter and allowed to come to the
boiling point, served with fowls, is a fine accompaniment.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEGETABLES APPROPRIATE TO DIFFERENT DISHES.</b></p>
<p>Potatoes are good with all meats. With fowls they are nicest
mashed. Sweet potatoes are most appropriate with roast meats, as
also are onions, winter squash, cucumbers and asparagus.</p>
<p>Carrots, parsnips, turnips, greens and cabbage are generally
eaten with boiled meat, and corn, beets, peas and beans are
appropriate to either boiled or roasted meat. Mashed turnip is good
with roast pork and with boiled meats. Tomatoes are good with
almost every kind of meats, especially with roasts.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WARM DISHES FOR BREAKFAST.</b></p>
<p>The following of hot breakfast dishes may be of assistance in
knowing what to provide for the comfortable meal called
breakfast.</p>

prefers it; these are all suitable for the breakfast table.</p>
<p>When obtainable always have a vase of choice flowers on the
breakfast table; also some fresh fruit, if convenient.</p>
<hr style='width: 65%;'>
<a name='SALADS' id="SALADS"></a>
<h2><b>SALADS.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Everything in the make-up of a salad should be of the freshest
material, the vegetables crisp and fresh, the oil or butter the
very best, meats, fowl and fish well cooked, pure cider or white
wine vinegar&mdash;in fact, every ingredient first class, to insure
success.</p>
<p>The vegetables used in salad are: Beet-root, onions, potatoes,
cabbage, lettuce, celery, cucumbers, lentils, haricots, winter
cress, peas, French beans, radish, cauliflower&mdash;all these may
be used judiciously in salad, if properly seasoned, according to
the following directions.</p>
<p>Chervil is a delicious salad herb, invariably found in all
salads prepared by a French <i>gourmet</i>. No man can be a true
epicure who is unfamiliar with this excellent herb. It may be
procured from the vegetable stands at Fulton and Washington markets
the year round. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 169]</span><a name=
'Page_169' id="Page_169"></a>Its leaves resemble parsley, but are
more divided, and a few of them added to a breakfast salad give a
delightful flavor.</p>
<p><i>Chervil Vinegar</i>.&mdash;A few drops of this vinegar added
to fish sauces or salads is excellent, and well repays the little
trouble taken in its preparation. Half fill a bottle with fresh or
dry chervil leaves; fill the bottle with good vinegar and heat it
gently by placing it in warm water, which bring to boiling point;
remove from the fire; when cool cork, and in two weeks it will be
ready for use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MAYONNAISE DRESSING.</b></p>
<p>Put the yolks of four fresh raw eggs, with two hard-boiled ones,
into a cold bowl. Rub these as smooth as possible before
introducing the oil; a good measure of oil is a tablespoonful to
each yolk of raw egg. All the art consists in introducing the oil
by degrees, a few drops at a time. You can never make a good salad
without taking plenty of time. When the oil is well mixed, and
assumes the appearance of jelly, put in two heaping teaspoonfuls of
dry table salt, one of pepper and one of made mustard. Never put in
salt and pepper before this stage of the process, because the salt
and pepper would coagulate the albumen of the eggs, and you could
not get the dressing smooth. Two tablespoonfuls of vinegar added
gradually.</p>
<p>The <i>Mayonnaise</i> should be the thickness of thick cream
when finished, but if it looks like curdling when mixing it, set in
the ice-box or in a <i>cold</i> place for about forty minutes or an
hour, then mix it again. It is a good idea to place it in a pan of
cracked ice while mixing.</p>
<p>For lobster salad, use the <i>coral</i>, mashed and pressed
through a sieve, then add to the above.</p>
<p>Salad dressing should be kept in a separate bowl in a cold,
place, and not mixed with the salad until the moment it is to be

<p><b>DRESSING FOR COLD SLAW. (Cabbage Salad.)</b></p>
<p>Beat up two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, add a piece
of butter the size of half an egg, a teaspoonful of mustard, a
little pepper, and lastly a teacup of vinegar. Put all of these
ingredients into a dish over the fire and cook like a soft custard.
Some think it im<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 170]</span><a name=
'Page_170' id="Page_170"></a>proved by adding half a cupful of
thick sweet cream to this dressing; in that case use less vinegar.
Either way is very fine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALAD CREAM DRESSING. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>One cup fresh cream, one spoonful fine flour, the whites of two
eggs beaten stiff, three spoonfuls of vinegar, two spoonfuls of
salad oil or soft butter, two spoonfuls of powdered sugar, one
teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful of
made mustard. Heat cream almost to boiling; stir in the flour,
previously wet with cold milk; boil two minutes, stirring all the
time; add sugar and take from fire. When half cold, beat in whipped
whites of egg; set aside to cool. When quite cold, whip in the oil
or butter, pepper, mustard and salt; if the salad is ready, add
vinegar and pour at once over it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM DRESSING. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of whipped sweet cream, two of sugar and four
of vinegar; beat well and pour over the cabbage, previously cut
very fine and seasoned with salt.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH SALAD DRESSING.</b></p>
<p>Mix one saltspoon of pepper with one of salt; add three
tablespoonfuls of olive oil and one even tablespoonful of onion
scraped fine; then one tablespoonful of vinegar; when well mixed,
pour the mixture over your salad and stir all till well
mingled.</p>
<p>The merit of a salad is that it should be cool, fresh and crisp.
For vegetables use only the delicate white stalks of celery, the
small heart-leaves of lettuce; or tenderest stalks and leaves of
the white cabbage. Keep the vegetable portion crisp and fresh until
the time for serving, when add the meat. For chicken and fish
salads use the "Mayonnaise dressing." For simple vegetable salads
the French dressing is most appropriate, using onion rather than
garlic.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MIXED SUMMER SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Three heads of lettuce, two teaspoonfuls of green mustard
leaves, a handful of water cresses, five tender radishes, one
cucumber, three hard-boiled eggs, two teaspoonfuls of white sugar,
one teaspoonful of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 171]</span><a name=
'Page_171' id="Page_171"></a>salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, one
teaspoonful of made mustard, one teacupful of vinegar, half a
teacupful of oil.</p>
<p>Mix all well together, and serve with a lump of ice in the
middle.</p>
<p>"<i>Common Sense in the Household</i>."</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Boil the fowls tender and remove all the fat, gristle and skin;
mince the meat in small pieces, but do not hash it. To one chicken
put twice and a half its weight in celery, cut in pieces of about
one-quarter of an inch; mix thoroughly and set it in a cool
place&mdash;the ice chest.</p>
<p>In the meantime prepare a "Mayonnaise dressing," and when ready
for the table pour this dressing over the chicken and celery,
tossing and mixing it thoroughly. Set it in a cool place until
ready to serve. Garnish with celery tips, or cold hard-boiled eggs,
lettuce leaves, from the heart, cold boiled beets or capers,
olives.</p>
<p>Crisp cabbage is a good substitute for celery; when celery is
not to be had use celery vinegar in the dressing. Turkey makes a
fine salad.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LOBSTER SALAD. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Prepare a sauce with the <i>coral</i> of a fine, new lobster,
boiled fresh for about half an hour. Pound and rub it smooth, and
mix very gradually with a dressing made from the yolks of two
hard-boiled eggs, a tablespoonful of made mustard, three of salad
oil, two of vinegar, one of white powdered sugar, a small
teaspoonful of salt, as much black pepper, a pinch of cayenne and
yolks of two fresh eggs. Next fill your salad bowl with some shred
lettuce, the better part of two leaving the small curled centre to
garnish your dish with. Mingle with this the flesh of your lobster,
torn, broken or cut into bits seasoned with salt and pepper and a
small portion of the dressing. Pour over the whole the rest of the
dressing; put your lettuce-hearts down the centre and arrange upon
the sides slices of hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LOBSTER SALAD. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Using canned lobsters, take a can, skim off all the oil on the
surface, and chop the meat up coarsely on a flat dish. Prepare the
same way six heads of celery; mix a teaspoonful of mustard into a
smooth paste with a little vinegar; add yolks of two fresh eggs; a
tablespoonful of butter, creamed, a small teaspoonful of salt, the
same of pep<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 172]</span><a name='Page_172'
id="Page_172"></a>per, a quarter of a teaspoonful of cayenne
pepper, a gill of vinegar, and the mashed yolks of two hard-boiled
eggs. Mix a small portion of the dressing with the celery and meat,
and turn the remainder over all. Garnish with the green tops of
celery and a hard-boiled egg, cut into thin rings.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Take a fresh white fish or trout, boil and chop it, but not too
fine; put with the same quantity of chopped cabbage, celery or
lettuce; season the same as chicken salad. Garnish with the tender
leaves of the heart of lettuce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Drain the liquor from a quart of fresh oysters. Put them in hot
vinegar enough to cover them placed over the fire; let them remain
until <i>plump</i>, but not cooked; then drop them immediately in
cold water, drain off, and mix with them two pickled cucumbers cut
fine, also a quart of celery cut in dice pieces, some seasoning of
salt and pepper. Mix all well together, tossing up with a silver
fork. Pour over the whole a "Mayonnaise dressing." Garnish with
celery tips and slices of hard-boiled eggs arranged tastefully.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DUTCH SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Wash, split and bone a dozen anchovies, and roll each one up;
wash, split and bone one herring, and cut it up into small pieces;
cut up into dice an equal quantity of Bologna or Lyons sausage, or
of smoked ham and sausages; also, an equal quantity of the breast
of cold roast fowl, or veal; add likewise, always in the same
quantity, and cut into dice, beet-roots, pickled cucumbers, cold
boiled potatoes cut in larger dice, and in quantity according to
taste, but at least thrice as much potato as anything else; add a
tablespoohful of capers, the yolks and whites of some hard-boiled
eggs, minced separately, and a dozen stoned olives; mix all the
ingredients well together, reserving the olives and anchovies to
ornament the top of the bowl; beat up together oil and Tarragon
vinegar with white pepper and French mustard to taste; pour this
over the salad and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HAM SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Take cold boiled ham, fat and lean together, chop it until it is
thoroughly mixed and the pieces are about the size of peas; then
add <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 173]</span><a name='Page_173' id=
"Page_173"></a>to this an equal quantity of celery cut fine, if
celery is out of season, lettuce may be substituted. Line a dish
thickly with lettuce leaves and fill with the chopped ham and
celery. Make a dressing the same as for cold slaw and turn over the
whole. Very fine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRAB SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Boil three dozen hard-shell crabs twenty-five minutes; drain and
let them cool gradually; remove the upper shell and the tail, break
the remainder apart and pick out the meat carefully. The large
claws should not be forgotten, for they contain a dainty morsel,
and the creamy fat attached to the upper shell should not be
overlooked. Line a salad bowl with the small white leaves of two
heads of lettuce, add the crab meat, pour over it a "Mayonnaise"
garnish with crab claws, hard-boiled eggs and little mounds of
cress leaves, which may be mixed with the salad when served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD SLAW.</b></p>
<p>Select the finest head of bleached cabbage&mdash;that is to say
one of the finest and most compact of the more delicate varieties;
cut up enough into shreds to fill a large vegetable dish or salad
bowl&mdash;that to be regulated by the size of the cabbage and the
quantity required; shave very fine and after that chop up, the more
thoroughly the better. Put this into a dish in which it is to be
served, after seasoning it well with salt and pepper. Turn over it
a dressing made as for cold slaw; mix it well and garnish with
slices of hard-boiled eggs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN COLD SLAW.</b></p>
<p>Slice cabbage very fine; season with salt, pepper and a little
sugar; pour over vinegar and mix thoroughly. It is nice served in
the centre of a platter with fried oysters around it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOT SLAW.</b></p>
<p>Cut the cabbage as for cold slaw; put it into a stewpan and set
it on the top of the stove for half an hour, or till hot all
through; do not let it boil. Then make a dressing the same as for
cold slaw, and, while hot, pour it over the hot cabbage. Stir it
until well mixed and the cabbage looks coddled. Serve
immediately.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 174]</span><a name='Page_174' id=
"Page_174"></a>
<p><b>TOMATO SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Peel and slice twelve good, sound, fresh tomatoes; the slices
about a quarter of an inch thick. Set them on the ice or in a
refrigerator while you make the dressing. Make the same as
"Mayonnaise," or you may use "Cream dressing." Take one head of the
broad-leaved variety of lettuce, wash, and arrange them neatly
around the sides of a salad bowl. Place the cold, sliced tomatoes
in the centre. Pour over the dressing and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ENDIVE.</b></p>
<p>This ought to be nicely blanched and crisp, and is the most
wholesome of all salads. Take two, cut away the root, remove the
dark green leaves, and pick off all the rest; wash and drain well,
add a few chives. Dress with "Mayonnaise dressing."</p>
<p>Endive is extensively cultivated for the adulteration of coffee;
is also a fine relish, and has broad leaves. Endive is of the same
nature as chicory, the leaves being curly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CELERY SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Prepare the dressing the same as for tomato salad; cut the
celery into bits half an inch long, and season. Serve at once
before the vinegar injures the crispness of the vegetables.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LETTUCE SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Take the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, and salt and mustard
to taste; mash it fine; make a paste by adding a dessertspoonful of
olive oil or melted butter (use butter always when it is difficult
to get <i>fresh</i> oil); mix thoroughly, and then dilute by adding
<i>gradually</i> a teacupful of vinegar, and pour over the lettuce.
Garnish by <i>slicing</i> another egg and laying over the lettuce.
This is sufficient for a moderate-sized dish of lettuce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO SALAD, HOT.</b></p>
<p>Pare six or eight large potatoes, and boil till done, and slice
thin while hot; peel and cut up three large onions into small bits
and mix with the potatoes; cut up some breakfast bacon into small
bits, sufficient to fill a teacup and fry it a light brown; remove
the meat, and into the grease stir three tablespoonfuls of vinegar,
making a sour <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 175]</span><a name=
'Page_175' id="Page_175"></a>gravy, which with the bacon pour over
the potato and onion; mix lightly. To be eaten when hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO SALAD, COLD.</b></p>
<p>Chop cold boiled potatoes fine, with enough raw onions to season
nicely; make a dressing as for lettuce salad, and pour over it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEAN SALAD.</b></p>
<p>String young beans; break into half-inch pieces or leave whole;
wash and cook soft in salt water; drain well; add finely chopped
onions, pepper, salt and vinegar; when cool, add olive oil or
melted butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO DRESS CUCUMBERS RAW.</b></p>
<p>They should be as fresh from the vine as possible, few
vegetables being more unwholesome when long gathered. As soon as
they are brought in lay them in cold water. Just before they are to
go to the table take them out, pare them and slice them into a pan
of fresh cold water. When they are all sliced, transfer them to a
deep dish; season them with a little salt and black pepper, and
pour over them some of the best vinegar. You may mix with them a
small quantity of sliced onions, not to be eaten, but to
communicate a slight flavor of onion to the vinegar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CELERY UNDRESSED.</b></p>
<p>Celery is sometimes sent to the table without dressing. Scrape
the outside stalks, and cut off the green tops and the roots; lay
it in cold water until near the time to serve, then change the
water, in which let it stand three or four minutes; split the
stalks in three, with a sharp knife, being careful not to break
them, and serve in goblet-shaped salad glasses.</p>
<p>To crisp celery, let it lie in ice-water two hours before
serving; to fringe the stalks, stick several coarse needles into a
cork, and draw the stalk half way from the top through the needles
several times and lay in the refrigerator to curl and crisp.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RADISHES.</b></p>
<p>All the varieties are generally served in the same manner, by
scraping and placing on the table in glasses containing some cold
water to keep them fresh looking.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 176]</span><a name='Page_176' id=
"Page_176"></a>
<p><b>PEPPERGRASS AND CRESS.</b></p>
<p>These are used mostly as an appetizer, served simply with salt.
Cresses are occasionally used in making salad.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HORSE-RADISH.</b></p>
<p>Horse-radish is an agreeable relish, and has a particularly
fresh taste in the spring; is scraped fine or grated, and set on
the table in a small covered cup; much that is bottled and sold as
horse-radish is adulterated with grated turnip.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LETTUCE.</b></p>
<p>Wash each leaf separately, breaking them from the head; crisp in
ice-water and serve the leaves whole, to be prepared at table,
providing hard-boiled eggs cut in halves or slices, oil and other
ingredients, to be mixed at table to individual taste.</p>

<p><b>TOMATO CATSUP. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Put into two quarts of tomato pulp (or two cans of canned
tomatoes) one onion, cut fine, two tablespoonfuls of salt and three
tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. Boil until quite thick; then take
from the fire and strain it through a sieve, working it until it is
all through but the seeds. Put it back on the stove, and add two
tablespoonfuls of mustard, one of allspice, one of black pepper and
one of cinnamon, one teaspoonful of ground cloves, half a
teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one grated nutmeg, one pint of good
vinegar; boil it until it will just run from the mouth of a bottle.
It should be watched, stirred often, that it does not burn. If
sealed tight while <i>hot</i>, in large-mouthed bottles, it will
keep good for years.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO CATSUP. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Cook one gallon of choice ripe tomatoes; strain them, and cook
again until they become quite thick. About fifteen minutes before
taking up put into them a small level teaspoonful of cayenne
pepper, one tablespoonful of mustard seed, half a tablespoonful of
whole <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 177]</span><a name='Page_177' id=

tied in a thin muslin bag. At the same time, add one heaping
tablespoonful of sugar, and one teacupful of best vinegar and salt
to suit the taste. Seal up air-tight, either in bottles or jugs.
This is a valuable Southern recipe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN TOMATO CATSUP.</b></p>
<p>One peck of green tomatoes and two large onions sliced. Place
them in layers, sprinkling salt between; let them stand twenty-four
hours and then drain them. Add a quarter of a pound of mustard
seed, one ounce allspice, one ounce cloves, one ounce ground
mustard, one ounce ground ginger, two tablespoonfuls black pepper,
two teaspoonfuls celery seed, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar.
Put all in preserving-pan, cover with vinegar and boil two hours;
then strain through a sieve and bottle for use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WALNUT CATSUP.</b></p>
<p>One hundred walnuts, six ounces of shallots, one head of garlic,
half a pound of salt, two quarts of vinegar, two ounces of
anchovies, two ounces of pepper, a quarter of an ounce of mace,
half an ounce of cloves; beat in a large mortar a hundred green
walnuts until they are thoroughly broken; then put them into a jar
with six ounces of shallots cut into pieces, a head of garlic, two
quarts of vinegar and the half pound of salt; let them stand for a
fortnight, stirring them twice a day. Strain off the liquor, put
into a stewpan with the anchovies, whole pepper, half an ounce of
cloves and a quarter of an ounce of mace; boil it half an hour,
skimming it well. Strain it off, and, when cold, pour it clear from
any sediment into small bottles, cork it down closely and store it
in a dry place. The sediment can be used for flavoring sauces.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER CATSUP.</b></p>
<p>One pint of oyster meats, one teacupful of sherry, a
tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, the same of
powdered mace, a gill of cider vinegar.</p>
<p>Procure the oysters very fresh and open sufficient to fill a
pint measure; save the liquor and scald the oysters in it with the
sherry; strain the oysters and chop them fine with the salt,
cayenne and mace, until reduced to a pulp; then add it to the
liquor in which they were scalded; boil it again five minutes and
skim well; rub the whole <span class='pagenum'>[Pg

and, when cold, bottle and cork closely. The corks should be
sealed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUSHROOM CATSUP.</b></p>
<p>Use the larger kind known as umbrellas or "flaps." They must be
very fresh and not gathered in very wet weather, or the catsup will
be less apt to keep. Wash and cut them in two to four pieces, and
place them in a wide, flat jar or crock in layers, sprinkling each
layer with salt, and let them stand for twenty-four hours; take
them out and press out the juice, when bottle and cork; put the
mushrooms back again, and in another twenty-four hours press them
again; bottle and cork; repeat this for the third time, and then
mix together all the juice extracted; add to it pepper, allspice,
one or more cloves according to quantity, pounded together; boil
the whole, and skim as long as any scum rises; bottle when cool;
put in each bottle two cloves and a pepper-corn. Cork and seal, put
in a dry place, and it will keep for years.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOOSEBERRY CATSUP.</b></p>
<p>Ten pounds of fruit gathered just before ripening, five pounds
of sugar, one quart of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls each of ground
black pepper, allspice and cinnamon. Boil the fruit in vinegar
until reduced to a pulp, then add sugar and the other seasoning.
Seal it hot.</p>
<p>Grape catsup is made in the same manner.</p>

sugar, one teaspoonful of pepper, one of cloves, one of mustard,
two of cinnamon, and two medium-sized onions, chopped <i>very</i>
fine. Stir all together, adding a tablespoonful of salt and a pint
of vinegar. Place over the fire and boil one hour, and bottle while
hot; seal very tight. It should be about as thick as tomato catsup,
so that it will just run from the bottle.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CELERY VINEGAR.</b></p>
<p>A quart of fresh celery, chopped fine, or a quarter of a pound

<a name='PICKLES' id="PICKLES"></a>
<h2><b>PICKLES.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Pickles should never be put into vessels of brass, copper or
tin, as the action of the acid on such metals often results in
poisoning the pickles. Porcelain or granite-ware is the best for
such purposes.</p>
<p>Vinegar that is used for pickling should be the best cider or
white-wine, and should never be boiled more than five or six
minutes, as it reduces its strength. In putting away pickles, use
stone or glass jars; the glazing on common earthenware is rendered
injurious by the action of the vinegar. When the jar is nearly
filled with the pickles, the vinegar should completely cover them,
and if there is any appearance of their not doing well, turn off
the vinegar, cover with fresh <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
180]</span><a name='Page_180' id="Page_180"></a>vinegar and spices.
Alum in small quantities is useful in making them firm and crisp.
In using ground spices, tie them up in muslin bags.</p>
<p>To green pickles, put green grape-vine leaves or green cabbage
leaves between them when heating. Another way is to heat them in
strong ginger tea. Pickles should be kept closely covered, put into
glass jars and sealed tightly.</p>
<p>"Turmeric" is India saffron, and is used very much in pickling
as a coloring.</p>
<p>A piece of horse-radish put into a jar of pickles will keep the
vinegar from losing its strength, and the pickles will keep sound
much longer, especially tomato pickles.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUCUMBER PICKLES.</b></p>
<p>Select the medium, small-sized cucumbers. For one bushel make a
brine that will bear up an egg; heat it boiling hot and pour it
over the cucumbers; let them stand twenty-four hours, then wipe
them dry; heat some vinegar boiling hot and pour over them,
standing again twenty-four hours. Now change the vinegar, putting
on fresh vinegar, adding one quart of brown sugar, a pint of white
mustard seed, a small handful of whole cloves, the same of cinnamon
sticks, a piece of alum the size of an egg, half a cup of celery
seed; heat it all boiling hot and pour over the cucumbers.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SLICED CUCUMBER PICKLE.</b></p>
<p>Take one gallon of medium-sized cucumbers, put them into a jar
or pail. Put into enough <i>boiling</i> water to cover them a small
handful of salt, turn it over them and cover closely; repeat this
three mornings, and the fourth morning scald enough cider vinegar
to cover them, putting into it a piece of alum as large as a
walnut, a teacup of horse-radish root cut up fine; then tie up in a
small muslin bag, one teaspoonful of mustard, one of ground cloves,
and one of cinnamon. Slice up the cucumbers half of an inch thick,
place them in glass jars and pour the scalding vinegar over them.
Seal tight and they will keep good a year or more.</p>

<br>
<p><b>CUCUMBER PICKLES. (For Winter Use.)</b></p>
<p>A good way to put down cucumbers, a few at a time:&mdash;</p>
<p>When gathered from the vines, wash, and put in a firkin or half
barrel layers or cucumbers and rock-salt alternately, enough salt
to make <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 181]</span><a name='Page_181' id=
"Page_181"></a>sufficient brine to cover them, no water; cover with
a cloth; keep them under the brine with a heavy board; take off the
cloth, and rinse it every time you put in fresh cucumbers, as a
scum will rise and settle upon it. Use plenty of salt and it will
keep a year. To prepare pickles for use, soak in hot water, and
keep in a warm place until they are fresh enough, then pour spiced
vinegar over them and let them stand over night, then pour that off
and put on fresh.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN TOMATO PICKLES. (Sweet.)</b></p>
<p>One peck of green tomatoes, sliced the day before you are ready
for pickling, sprinkling them through and through with salt, not
<i>too</i> heavily; in the morning drain off the liquor that will
drain from them. Have a dozen good-sized onions rather coarsely
sliced; take a suitable kettle and put in a layer of the sliced
tomatoes, then of onions, and between each layer sprinkle the
following spices: Six <i>red</i> peppers chopped coarsely, one cup
of sugar, one tablespoonful of ground allspice, one tablespoonful
of ground cinnamon, a teaspoonful of cloves, one tablespoonful of
mustard. Turn over three pints of good vinegar, or enough to
completely cover them; boil until tender. This is a choice
recipe.</p>
<p>If the flavor of onions is objectionable, the pickle is equally
as good without them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN TOMATO PICKLES. (Sour.)</b></p>
<p>Wash and slice, without peeling, one peck of sound green
tomatoes, put them into a jar in layers with a slight sprinkling of
salt between. This may be done over night; in the morning drain off
the liquor that has accumulated. Have two dozen medium-sized onions
peeled and sliced, also six red peppers chopped fine. Make some
spiced vinegar by boiling for half an hour a quart of cider vinegar
with whole spices in it. Now take a porcelain kettle and place in
it some of the sliced tomatoes, then some of the sliced onions;
shake in some black pepper and some of the chopped red peppers;
pour over some of the spiced vinegar; then repeat with the
tomatoes, onions, etc., until the kettle is full; cover with cold,
pure cider vinegar and cook until tender, but not too soft. Turn
into a jar well covered and set in a cool place.</p>

<p>Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms; to each quart of
mushrooms two blades pounded mace, one ounce ground pepper, salt to
taste. Choose some nice young button mushrooms for pickling and rub
off the skin with a piece of flannel and salt, and cut off the
stalks; if very large, take out the red inside, and reject the
black ones, as they are too old. Put them in a stewpan, sprinkle
salt over them, with pounded mace and pepper in the above
proportion; shake them well over a clear fire until the liquor
flows and keep them there until it is all dried up again; then add
as much vinegar as will cover them; just let it simmer for one
minute and store it away in stone jars for use. When cold tie down
with bladder and keep in a dry place; they will remain good for a
length of time, and are generally considered excellent for
flavoring stews and other dishes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED CABBAGE. (Purple.)</b></p>
<p>Cut a sound cabbage into quarters, spread it on a large flat
platter or dish and sprinkle thickly with salt; set it in a cool
place for twenty-four hours; then drain off the brine, wipe it dry
and lay it in the sun two hours, and cover with cold vinegar for
twelve hours. Prepare a pickle by seasoning enough vinegar to cover
the cabbage with equal quantities of mace, allspice, cinnamon and
black pepper, a cup of sugar to every gallon of vinegar, and a
teaspoonful of celery seed to every pint. Pack the cabbage in a
stone jar; boil the vinegar and spices five minutes and pour on
hot. Cover and set away in a cool, dry place. It will be good in a
month. A few slices of beetroot improves the color.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED WHITE CABBAGE.</b></p>
<p>This recipe recommends itself as of a delightful flavor yet
easily made, and a convenient substitute for the old-fashioned,
tedious method of pickling the same vegetable. Take a peck of
quartered cabbage, put a layer of cabbage and one of salt, let it
remain over night; in the morning squeeze them and put them on the
fire, with four chopped onions covered with vinegar; boil for half
an hour, then add one ounce of turmeric, one gill of black pepper,
one gill of celery seed, a few cloves, one tablespoonful of
allspice, a few pieces of ginger, half an ounce of mace, and two
pounds of brown sugar. Let it boil <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
183]</span><a name='Page_183' id="Page_183"></a>half an hour
longer, and when cold it is fit for use. Four tablespoonfuls of
made mustard should be added with the other ingredients.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED CAULIFLOWER.</b></p>
<p>Break the heads into small pieces and boil ten or fifteen
minutes in salt and water; remove from the water and drain
carefully. When cold, place in a jar, and pour over it hot vinegar,
in which has been scalded a liberal supply of whole cloves, pepper,
allspice and white mustard. Tie the spices in a bag, and, on
removing the vinegar from the fire, stir into each quart of it two
teaspoonfuls of French mustard, and half a cup of white sugar.
Cover tightly and be sure to have the vinegar cover the pickle.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED GREEN PEPPERS.</b></p>
<p>Take two dozen large, green, bell peppers, extract the seeds by
cutting a slit in the side (so as to leave them whole). Make a
strong brine and pour over them; let them stand twenty-four hours.
Take them out of the brine, and soak them in water for a day and a
night; now turn off this water and scald some vinegar, in which put
a small piece of alum, and pour over them, letting them stand three
days. Prepare a stuffing of two hard heads of white cabbage,
chopped fine, seasoned slightly with salt and a cup of white
mustard seed; mix it well and stuff the peppers hard and full;
stitch up, place them in a stone jar, and pour over spiced vinegar
scalding hot. Cover tightly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN PEPPER MANGOES.</b></p>
<p>Select firm, sound, green peppers, and add a few red ones as
they are ornamental and look well upon the table. With a sharp
knife remove the top, take out the seed, soak over night in salt
water, then fill with chopped cabbage and green tomatoes, seasoned
with salt, mustard seed and ground cloves. Sew on the top. Boil
vinegar sufficient to cover them, with a cup of brown sugar, and
pour over the mangoes. Do this three mornings, then seal.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOWCHOW. (Superior English Recipe.)</b></p>
<p>This excellent pickle is seldom made at home, as we can get the
imported article so much better than it can be made from the usual
recipes. This we vouch for being as near the genuine article as can
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 184]</span><a name='Page_184' id=
"Page_184"></a>be made: One quart of young, tiny cucumbers, not
over two inches long, two quarts of <i>very</i> small white onions,
two quarts of tender string beans, each one cut in halves, three
quarts of green tomatoes, sliced and chopped very coarsely, two
fresh heads of cauliflower, cut into small pieces, or two heads of
white, hard cabbage.</p>
<p>After preparing these articles, put them in a stone jar, mix
them together, sprinkling salt between them sparingly. Let them
stand twenty-four hours, then drain off <i>all</i> the brine that
has accumulated. Now put these vegetables in a preserving kettle
over the fire, sprinkling through them an ounce of turmeric for
coloring, six red peppers, chopped coarsely, four tablespoonfuls of
mustard seed, two of celery seed, two of whole allspice, two of
whole cloves, a coffee cup of sugar, and two-thirds of a teacup of
best ground mixed mustard. Pour on enough of the best cider vinegar
to cover the whole well; cover tightly and simmer all well until it
is cooked all through and seems tender, watching and stirring it
often. Put in bottles or glass jars. It grows better as it grows
older, especially if sealed when hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED ONIONS.</b></p>
<p>Peel small onions until they are white. Scald them in salt and
water until tender, then take them up, put them into wide-mouthed
bottles, and pour over them hot spiced vinegar; when cold cork them
close. Keep in a dry, dark place. A tablespoonful of sweet oil may
be put in the bottles before the cork. The best sort of onions for
pickling are the small white buttons.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED MANGOES.</b></p>
<p>Let the mangoes, or young musk-melons, lie in salt water, strong
enough to bear an egg, for two weeks; then soak them in pure water
for two days, changing the water two or three times; then remove
the seeds and put the mangoes in a kettle, first a layer of grape
leaves, then mangoes, and so on until all are in, covering the top
with leaves; add a lump of alum the size of a hickory nut; pour
vinegar over them and boil them ten or fifteen minutes; remove the
leaves and let the pickles stand in this vinegar for a week; then
stuff them with the following mixture: One pound of ginger soaked
in brine for a day or two, and cut in slices, one ounce of black
pepper, one of mace, one of allspice, one of turmeric, half a pound
of garlic, soaked <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 185]</span><a name=
'Page_185' id="Page_185"></a>for a day or two in brine and then
dried; one pint grated horse-radish, one of black mustard seed and
one of white mustard seed; bruise all the spices and mix with a
teacup of pure olive oil; to each mango add one teaspoonful of
brown sugar; cut one solid head of cabbage fine; add one pint of
small onions, a few small cucumbers and green tomatoes; lay them in
brine a day and a night, then drain them well and add the imperfect
mangoes chopped fine and the spices; mix thoroughly, stuff the
mangoes and tie them; put them in a stone jar and pour over them
the best cider vinegar; set them in a bright, dry place until they
are canned. In a month add three pounds of brown sugar; if this is
not sufficient, add more until agreeable to taste. This is for four
dozen mangoes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLE OF RIPE CUCUMBERS.</b></p>
<p>This is a French recipe and is the most excellent of all the
high-flavored condiments; it is made by <i>sun-drying</i> thirty
<i>old</i>, full grown cucumbers, which have first been pared and
split, had the seeds taken out, been salted and let stand
twenty-four hours. The sun should be permitted to <i>dry</i>, not
simply drain them. When they are moderately dry, wash them with
vinegar and place them in layers in a jar, alternating them with a
layer of horse-radish, mustard seed, garlic and onions for each
layer of cucumbers. Boil in one quart of vinegar, one ounce of race
ginger, half an ounce of allspice and the same of turmeric; when
cool pour this over the cucumbers, tie up tightly and set away.
This pickle requires several months to mature it, but is delicious
when old, keeps admirably, and only a little is needed as a
relish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED OYSTERS.</b></p>
<p>One gallon of oysters; wash them well in their own liquor;
carefully clear away the particles of shell, then put them into a
kettle, strain the liquor over them, add salt to your taste, let
them just come to the boiling point, or until the edges curl up;
then skim them out and lay in a dish to cool; put a sprig of mace
and a little cold pepper and allow the liquor to boil some time,
skimming it now and then so long as any skum rises. Pour it into a
pan and let it cool. When perfectly cool, add a half pint of strong
vinegar, place the oysters in a jar and pour the liquor over
them.</p>

<p><b>RIPE CUCUMBER PICKLES. (Sweet.)</b></p>
<p>Pare and seed ripe cucumbers. Slice each cucumber lengthwise
into four pieces, or cut it into fancy shapes, as preferred. Let
them stand twenty-four hours covered with cold vinegar. Drain them;
then put them into fresh vinegar, with two pounds of sugar and one
ounce of cassia buds to one quart of vinegar, and a tablespoonful
of salt. Boil all together twenty minutes. Cover them closely in a
jar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICCALILLI.</b></p>
<p>One peck of green tomatoes; eight large onions chopped fine,
with one cup of salt well stirred in. Let it stand over night; in
the morning drain off all the liquor. Now take two quarts of water
and one of vinegar, boil all together twenty minutes. Drain all
through a sieve or colander. Put it back into the kettle again;
turn over it two quarts of vinegar, one pound of sugar, half a
pound of white mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of ground pepper,
two of cinnamon, one of cloves, two of ginger, one of allspice, and
half a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. Boil all together fifteen
minutes or until tender. Stir it often to prevent scorching. Seal
in glass jars.</p>
<p>A most delicious accompaniment for any kind of meat or fish.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Mrs. St. Johns.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Pickled eggs are very easily prepared and most excellent as an
accompaniment for cold meats. Boil quite hard three dozen eggs,
drop in cold water and remove the shells, and pack them when
entirely cold in a wide-mouthed jar, large enough to let them in or
out without breaking. Take as much vinegar as you think will cover
them entirely and boil it in white pepper, allspice, a little root
ginger; pack them in stone or wide-mouthed glass jars, occasionally
putting in a tablespoonful of white and black mustard seed mixed, a
small piece of race ginger, garlic, if liked, horse-radish
ungrated, whole cloves, and a very little allspice. Slice two of
three green peppers, and add in very small quantities. They will be
fit for use in eight or ten days.</p>
<br>
<p><b>AN ORNAMENTAL PICKLE.</b></p>
<p>Boil fresh eggs half an hour, then put them in cold water. Boil
red beets until tender, peel and cut in dice form, and cover with
vinegar, spiced; shell the eggs and drop into the pickle jar.</p>

<p><b>EAST INDIA PICKLE.</b></p>
<p>Lay in strong brine for two weeks, or until convenient to use
them, small cucumbers, very small common white onions, snap beans,
gherkins, hard white cabbage quartered, plums, peaches, pears,
lemons, green tomatoes and anything else you may wish. When ready,
take them out of the brine and simmer in pure water until tender
enough to stick a straw through&mdash;if still too salt, soak in
clear water; drain thoroughly and lay them in vinegar in which is
dissolved one ounce of turmeric to the gallon. For five gallons of
pickle, take two ounces of mace, two of cloves, two of cinnamon,
two of allspice, two of celery seed, a quarter of a pound of white
race ginger, cracked fine, half a pound of white mustard seed, half
a pint of small red peppers, quarter of a pound of grated
horse-radish, half a pint of flour mustard, two ounces of turmeric,
half a pint of garlic, if you like; soak in two gallons of cider
vinegar for two weeks, stirring daily. After the pickles have lain
in the turmeric vinegar for a week, take them out and put in jars
or casks, one layer of pickle and one of spice out of the vinegar,
till all is used. If the turmeric vinegar is still good and strong,
add it and the spiced vinegar. If the turmeric vinegar be much
diluted do not use it, but add enough fresh to the spiced to cover
the pickles; put it on the fire with a pound of brown sugar to each
gallon; when boiling, pour over the pickle. Repeat this two or
three times as your taste may direct.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MIXED PICKLES.</b></p>
<p>Scald in salt water until tender cauliflower heads, small
onions, peppers, cucumbers cut in dice, nasturtiums and green
beans; then drain until dry and pack into wide-mouthed bottles.
Boil in each pint of cider vinegar one tablespoonful of sugar, half
a teaspoonful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of mustard; pour over
the pickle and seal carefully. Other spices may be added if
liked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLUEBERRY PICKLES.</b></p>
<p>For blueberry pickles, old jars which have lost their covers, or
whose edges have been broken so that the covers will not fit
tightly, serve an excellent purpose as these pickles <i>must
not</i> be kept air-tight.</p>
<p>Pick over your berries, using only sound ones; fill your jars or
wide-mouthed bottles to within an inch of the top, then pour in
mo<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 188]</span><a name='Page_188' id=
"Page_188"></a>lasses enough to settle down into <i>all</i> the
spaces; this cannot be done in a moment, as molasses does not
<i>run</i> very freely. Only lazy people will feel obliged to stand
by and watch its progress. As it settles, pour in more until the
berries are covered. Then tie over the top a piece of cotton cloth
to keep the flies and other insects out and set away in the
preserve closet. Cheap molasses is good enough, and your pickles
will soon be "sharp." Wild grapes may be pickled in the same
manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED BUTTERNUTS AND WALNUTS.</b></p>
<p>These nuts are in the best state for pickling when the outside
shell can be penetrated by the head of a pin. Scald them and rub
off the outside skin, put them in a strong brine for six days,
changing the water every other day, keeping them closely covered
from the air. Then drain and wipe them (piercing each nut through
in several places with a large needle) and prepare the pickle as
follows: For a hundred large nuts, take of black pepper and ginger
root each an ounce; and of cloves, mace and nutmeg, each a half
ounce. Pound all the spices to powder and mix them well together,
adding two large spoonfuls of mustard seed. Put the nuts into jars
(having first stuck each of them through in several places with a
large needle), strewing the powdered seasoning between every layer
of nuts. Boil for five minutes a gallon of the very best cider
vinegar and pour it boiling hot upon the nuts. Secure the jars
closely with corks. You may begin to eat the nuts in a
fortnight.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WATERMELON PICKLE.</b></p>
<p>Ten pounds of watermelon rind boiled in pure water until tender;
drain the water off, and make a syrup of two pounds of white sugar,
one quart of vinegar, half an ounce of cloves, one ounce of
cinnamon. The syrup to be poured over the rind boiling hot three
days in succession.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWEET PICKLE FOR FRUIT.</b></p>
<p>Most of the recipes for making a sweet pickle for fruit, such as
cling-stone peaches, damsons, plums, cherries, apricots, etc., are
so similar, that we give that which is most successfully used.</p>
<p>To every quart of fruit, allow a cup of white sugar and a large
pint of good cider vinegar, adding half an ounce of <i>stick</i>
cinnamon,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 189]</span><a name='Page_189'
id="Page_189"></a> one tablespoonful of <i>whole</i> cloves, the
same of whole allspice. Let it come to a boil, and pour it hot over
the fruit; repeat this two or three days in succession; then seal
hot in glass jars if you wish to keep it for a long time.</p>
<p>The <i>fruit</i>, not the liquor, is to be eaten, and used the
same as any pickle. Some confound this with "Spiced Fruit," which
is not treated the same, one being a pickle, the other a spiced
preserve boiled down thick.</p>
<p>Damsons and plums should be pricked with a needle, and peaches
washed with a weak lye, and then rubbed with a coarse cloth to
remove the fur.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEAR PICKLE.</b></p>
<p>Select small, sound ones, remove the blossom end, stick them
with a fork, allow to each quart of pears one pint of cider vinegar
and one cup of sugar, put in a teaspoonful allspice, cinnamon and
cloves to boil with the vinegar; then add the pears and boil, and
seal in jars.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPICED CURRANTS.</b></p>
<p>Seven pounds of fruit, four pounds of sugar, one pint of good
cider vinegar, one tablespoonful of ground cinnamon, one
teaspoonful of cloves. Put into a kettle and boil until the fruit
is soft; then skim out the fruit, putting it on dishes until the
syrup is boiled down thick. Turn the fruit back into the syrup
again, so as to heat it all through; then seal it hot in glass
jars, and set it in a cool, dark place.</p>
<p>Any tart fruit may be put up in this way, and is considered a
very good embellishment for cold meats.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPICED PLUMS.</b></p>
<p>Seven pounds of plums, one pint of <i>cider</i> vinegar, four
pounds of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of broken cinnamon bark, half
as much of whole cloves and the same of broken nutmeg; place these
in a muslin bag and simmer them in a little vinegar and water for
half an hour; then add it all to the vinegar and sugar, and bring
to a boil; add the plums and boil carefully until they are cooked
tender. Before cooking the plums they should be pierced with a
darning needle several times; this will prevent the skins bursting
while cooking.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 190]</span><a name='Page_190' id=
"Page_190"></a>
<p><b>SPICED GRAPES.</b></p>
<p>Take the pulp from the grapes, preserving the skins. Boil the
pulp and rub through a colander to get out the seeds; then add the
skins to the strained pulp and boil with the sugar, vinegar and
spices. To every seven pounds of grapes use four and one-half
pounds of sugar, one pint of good vinegar. Spice quite highly with
ground cloves and allspice, with a little cinnamon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PICKLED CHERRIES.</b></p>
<p>Select sound, large cherries, as large as you can get them; to
every quart of cherries allow a large cupful of vinegar, two
tablespoonfuls of sugar, a dozen whole cloves, and half a dozen
blades of mace; put the vinegar and sugar on to heat with the
spices; boil five minutes, turn out into a covered stoneware
vessel; cover and let it get perfectly cold; pack the cherries into
jars, and pour the vinegar over them when cold; cork tightly and
set away; they are fit for use almost immediately.</p>

<a name='VEGETABLES' id="VEGETABLES"></a>
<h2><b>VEGETABLES.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Vegetables of all kinds should be thoroughly picked over,
throwing out all decayed or unripe parts, then well washed in
several waters. Most vegetables, when peeled, are better when laid
in cold water a short time before cooking. When partly cooked a
little salt should be thrown into the water in which they are
boiled, and they should cook steadily after they are put on, not
allowed to stop boiling or simmering until they are thoroughly
done. Every sort of culinary vegetable is much better when freshly
gathered and cooked as soon as possible, and, when done, thoroughly
drained, and served immediately while hot.</p>
<p>Onions, cabbage, carrots and turnips should be cooked in a great
deal of water, boiled only long enough to sufficiently cook them,
and immediately drained. Longer boiling makes them insipid in
taste, and with <i>too little</i> water they turn a dark color.</p>
<p>Potatoes rank first in importance in the vegetable line, and
consequently should be properly served. It requires some little
intelligence to cook even so simple and common a dish as boiled
potatoes. In the first place, all defective or green ones should be
cast out; a bad one will flavor a whole dish. If they are not
uniform in size, they should be made so by cutting after they are
peeled. The best part of a potato, or the most nutritious, is next
to the skin, therefore they should be pared very thinly, if at all;
then, if old, the cores should be cut out, thrown into <i>cold</i>
water salted a little, and boiled until soft enough for a fork to
pierce through easily; drain immediately, and replace the kettle on
the fire with the cover partly removed, until they are completely
dried. New potatoes should be put into boiling water, and when
partly done salted a little. They should be prepared just in time
for cooking by scraping off the thin outside skin. They require
about twenty minutes to boil.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 192]</span><a name='Page_192' id=
"Page_192"></a>
<p><b>TO BOIL NEW POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Do not have the potatoes dug long before they are dressed, as
they are never good when they have been out of the ground for some
time. Well wash them, rub off the skins with a coarse cloth, and
put them in <i>boiling</i> water salted. Let them boil until
tender; try them with a fork, and when done pour the water away
from them; let them stand by the side of the fire with the lid of
the saucepan partly removed, and when the potatoes are thoroughly
dry, put them in a hot vegetable dish, with a piece of butter the
size of a walnut; pile the potatoes over this and serve. If the
potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed off; boil them in
their jackets; drain, peel and serve them as above, with a piece of
butter placed in the midst of them. They require twenty to thirty
minutes to cook. Serve them hot and plain, or with melted butter
over them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MASHED POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Take the quantity needed, pare off the skins and lay them in
cold water half an hour; then put them into a saucepan with a
little salt; cover with water and boil them until done. Drain off
the water and mash them fine with a potato masher. Have ready a
piece of butter the size of an egg, melted in half a cup of boiling
hot milk and a good pinch of salt; mix it well with the mashed
potatoes until they are a smooth paste, taking care that they are
not too wet. Put them into a vegetable dish, heaping them up and
smooth over the top, put a small piece of butter on the top in the
centre, and have dots of pepper here and there on the surface as
large as a half dime.</p>
<p>Some prefer using a heavy fork or wire beater, instead of a
potato masher, beating the potatoes quite light and heaping them up
in the dish without smoothing over the top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROWNED POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Mash them the same as the above, put them into a dish that they
are to be served in, smooth over the top and brush over with the
yolk of an egg, or spread on a bountiful supply of butter and dust
well with flour. Set in the oven to brown; it will brown in fifteen
minutes with a quick fire.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 193]</span><a name='Page_193' id=
"Page_193"></a>
<p><b>MASHED POTATOES. (Warmed Over.)</b></p>
<p>To two cupfuls of cold mashed potatoes add a half cupful of
milk, a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of butter, two
tablespoonfuls of flour and two eggs beaten to a froth. Mix the
whole until thoroughly light; then put into a pudding or vegetable
dish, spread a little butter over the top and bake a golden brown.
The quality depends upon very thoroughly beating the eggs before
adding them, so that the potato will remain light and porous after
baking, similar to sponge cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO PUFFS.</b></p>
<p>Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potato. While
<i>hot</i>, shape in balls about the size of an egg. Have a tin
sheet well buttered, and place the balls on it. As soon as all are
done, brush over with beaten egg. Brown in the oven. When done,
slip a knife under them and slide them upon a hot platter. Garnish
with parsley and serve immediately.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATOES &Aacute; LA CR&Ecirc;ME.</b></p>
<p>Heat a cupful of milk; stir in a heaping tablespoonful of butter
cut up in as much flour. Stir until smooth and thick; pepper and
salt, and add two cupfuls of cold boiled potatoes, sliced, and a
little very finely chopped parsley. Shake over the fire until the
potatoes are hot all through, and pour into a deep dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NEW POTATOES AND CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Wash and rub new potatoes with a coarse cloth or
scrubbing-brush; drop into boiling water and boil briskly until
done, and no more; press a potato against the side of the kettle
with a fork; if done, it will yield to a gentle pressure; in a
saucepan have ready some butter and cream, hot, but not boiling, a
little green parsley, pepper and salt; drain the potatoes, add the
mixture, put over hot water for a minute or two, and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SARATOGA CHIPS.</b></p>
<p>Peel good-sized potatoes, and slice them as evenly as possible.
Drop them into ice-water; have a kettle of very hot lard, as for
cakes; put a few at a time into a towel and shake, to dry the
moisture out of them, and then drop them into the boiling lard.
Stir them occasionally, and when of a light brown take them out
with a skimmer, and they will be crisp and not greasy. Sprinkle
salt over them while hot.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 194]</span><a name='Page_194' id=
"Page_194"></a>
<p><b>FRIED RAW POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Peel half a dozen medium-sized potatoes very evenly, cut them in
slices as thin as an egg-shell, and be sure to cut them from the
<i>breadth</i>, not the length, of the potato. Put a tablespoonful
each of butter and sweet lard into the frying pan, and as soon as
it boils add the sliced potatoes, sprinkling over them salt and
pepper to season them. Cover them with a tight-fitting lid, and let
the steam partly cook them; then remove it, and let them fry a
bright gold color, shaking and turning them carefully, so as to
brown equally. Serve very hot.</p>
<p>Fried, cold cooked potatoes may be fried by the same recipe,
only slice them a little thicker.</p>
<p><i>Remark</i>.&mdash;Boiled or steamed potatoes chopped up or
sliced while they are yet warm never fry so successfully as when
cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED POTATOES. (Kentucky Style.)</b></p>
<p>Peel and slice raw potatoes thin, the same as for frying. Butter
an earthen dish, put in a layer of potatoes, and season with salt,
pepper, butter, a bit of onion chopped fine, if liked; sprinkle a
little flour. Now put another layer of potatoes and the seasoning.
Continue in this way till the dish is filled. Just before putting
into the oven, pour a quart of hot milk over. Bake three-quarters
of an hour.</p>
<p>Cold boiled potatoes may be cooked the same. It requires less
time to bake them; they are delicious either way. If the onion is
disliked it can be omitted.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>This mode of cooking potatoes is now much in vogue, particularly
where they are wanted on a large scale, it being so very
convenient. Pare the potatoes, throw them into cold water as they
are peeled, then put them in a steamer. Place the steamer over a
saucepan of boiling water, and steam the potatoes from twenty to
forty minutes, according to the size and sort. When the fork goes
easily through them, they are done; then take them up, dish and
serve very quickly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO SNOW.</b></p>
<p>Choose some mealy potatoes that will boil exceedingly white;
pare them and cook them well, but not so as to be watery; drain
them, and mash and season them well. Put in the saucepan in which
they were <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 195]</span><a name='Page_195'
id="Page_195"></a>dressed, so as to keep them as hot as possible;
then press them through a wire sieve into the dish in which they
are to be served; strew a little fine salt upon them previous to
sending them to table. French cooks also add a small quantity of
pounded loaf sugar while they are being mashed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HASTY COOKED POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Wash and peel some potatoes; cut them into slices of about a
quarter of an inch in thickness; throw them into <i>boiling</i>
salted water, and, if of good quality, they will be done in about
ten minutes.</p>
<p>Strain off the water, put the potatoes into a hot dish, chop
them slightly, add pepper, salt, and a few small pieces of fresh
butter, and serve without loss of time.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FAVORITE WARMED POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>The potatoes should be boiled <i>whole with the skins on</i> in
plenty of water, well <i>salted</i>, and are much better for being
boiled the day before needed. Care should be taken that they are
not over cooked. Strip off the skins (not pare them with a knife)
and slice them nearly a quarter of an inch thick. Place them in a
chopping-bowl and sprinkle over them sufficient salt and pepper to
season them well; chop them all one way, then turn the
chopping-bowl half way around and chop across them, cutting them
into little square pieces the shape of dice. About twenty-five
minutes before serving time, place on the stove a saucepan (or any
suitable dish) containing a piece of butter the size of an egg;
when it begins to melt and run over the bottom of the dish, put in
a cup of rich sweet milk. When this boils up put in the chopped
potatoes; there should be about a quart of them; stir them a little
so that they become moistened through with the milk; then cover and
place them on the back of the stove, or in a moderate oven, where
they will heat through gradually. When heated through, stir
carefully from the bottom with a spoon and cover tightly again.
Keep hot until ready to serve. Baked potatoes are very good warmed
in this manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRISP POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Cut cold raw potatoes into shavings, cubes, or any small shape;
throw them, a few at a time, into boiling fat and toss them about
with a knife until they are a uniform light brown; drain and season
with salt and pepper. Fat is never hot enough while
bubbling&mdash;when it is ready it is still and smoking, but should
never burn.</p>

<p><b>LYONNAISE POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Take eight or ten good-sized cold boiled potatoes, slice them
end-wise, then crosswise, making them like dice in small squares.
When you are ready to cook them, heat some butter or good drippings
in a frying pan; fry in it one small onion (chopped fine) until it
begins to change color and look yellow. Now put in your potatoes,
sprinkle well with salt and pepper, stir well and cook about five
minutes, taking care that you do not break them. <i>They must not
brown.</i> Just before taking up stir in a tablespoonful of minced
parsley. Drain dry by shaking in a heated colander. Serve <i>very
hot</i>.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Delmonico</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO FILLETS.</b></p>
<p>Pare and slice the potatoes thin; cut them if you like in small
fillets about a quarter of an inch square, and as long as the
potato will admit; keep them in cold water until wanted, then drop
them into boiling lard; when nearly done, take them out with a
skimmer and drain them, boil up the lard again, drop the potatoes
back and fry till done; this operation causes the fillets to swell
up and puff.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO CROQUETTES. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Wash, peel and put four large potatoes in cold water, with a
pinch of salt, and set them over a brisk fire; when they are done
pour off all the water and mash them. Take another saucepan, and
put in it ten tablespoonfuls of milk and a lump of butter half the
size of an egg; put it over a brisk fire; as soon as the milk comes
to a boil, pour the potatoes into it, and stir them very fast with
a wooden spoon; when thoroughly mixed, take them from the fire and
put them on a dish. Take a tablespoonful and roll it in a clean
towel, making it oval in shape; dip it in a well-beaten egg, and
then in bread crumbs, and drop it in hot drippings or lard. Proceed
in this manner till all the potato is used, four potatoes making
six croquettes. Fry them a light brown all over, turning them
gently as may be necessary. When they are done, lay them on brown
paper or a hair sieve, to drain off all fat; then serve on a
napkin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO CROQUETTES. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Take two cups of cold mashed potatoes, season with a pinch of
salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of butter. Beat up the whites of
two eggs, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 197]</span><a name='Page_197'
id="Page_197"></a>and work all together thoroughly; make it into
small balls slightly flattened, dip them in the beaten yolks of the
eggs, then roll either in flour or cracker crumbs; fry the same as
fish-balls.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Delmonico's.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>POTATOES &Aacute; LA DELMONICO.</b></p>
<p>Cut the potatoes with a vegetable cutter into small balls about
the size of a marble; put them into a stewpan with plenty of butter
and a good sprinkling of salt; keep the saucepan covered, and shake
occasionally until they are quite done, which will be in about an
hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED POTATOES WITH EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Slice cold boiled potatoes and fry in good butter until brown;
beat up one or two eggs, and stir into them just as you dish them
for the table; do not leave them a moment on the fire after the
eggs are in, for if they harden they are not half so nice; one egg
is enough for three or four persons, unless they are very fond of
potatoes; if they are, have plenty and put in two.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Potatoes are either baked in their jackets or peeled; in either
case they should not be exposed to a fierce heat, which is
wasteful, inasmuch as thereby a great deal of vegetable is scorched
and rendered uneatable. They should be frequently turned while
being baked and kept from touching each other in the oven or dish.
When done in their skins, be particular to wash and brush them
before baking them. If convenient, they may be baked in wood-ashes,
or in a Dutch oven in front of the fire. When pared they should be
baked in a dish and fat of some kind added to prevent their
outsides from becoming burnt; they are ordinarily baked thus as an
accessory to baked meat.</p>
<p>Never serve potatoes, boiled or baked whole, in a closely
covered dish. They become sodden and clammy. Cover with a folded
napkin that allows the steam to escape, or absorbs the moisture.
They should be served promptly when done and require about
three-quarters of an hour to one hour to bake them, if of a good
size.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROWNED POTATOES WITH A ROAST. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>About three-quarters of an hour before taking up your roasts,
peel middling-sized potatoes, boil them until partly done, then
arrange <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 198]</span><a name='Page_198' id=
"Page_198"></a>them in the roasting-pan around the roast, basting
them with the drippings at the same time you do the meat, browning
them evenly. Serve hot with the meat. Many cooks partly boil the
potatoes before putting around the roast. New potatoes are very
good cooked around a roast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BROWNED POTATOES WITH A ROAST. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Peel, cook and mash the required quantity, adding while hot a
little chopped onion, pepper and salt; form it into small oval
balls and dredge them with flour; then place around the meat about
twenty minutes before it is taken from the oven. When nicely
browned, drain dry and serve hot with the meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWEET POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Boiled, steamed and baked the same as Irish potatoes; generally
cooked with their jackets on. Cold sweet potatoes may be cut in
slices across or lengthwise, and fried as common potatoes; or may
be cut in half and served cold.</p>
<p>Boiled sweet potatoes are very nice. Boil until partly done,
peel them and bake brown, basting them with butter or beef
drippings several times. Served hot. They should be a nice
brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED SWEET POTATOES.</b></p>
<p>Wash and scrape them, split them lengthwise. Steam or boil them
until nearly done. Drain, and put them in a baking dish, placing
over them lumps of butter, pepper and salt; sprinkle thickly with
sugar, and bake in the oven to a nice brown.</p>
<p>Hubbard squash is nice cooked in the same manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ONIONS BOILED.</b></p>
<p>The white silver-skins are the best species. To boil them peel
off the outside, cut off the ends, put them into cold water, and
into a stewpan and let them scald two minutes; then turn off that
water, pour on cold water salted a little, and boil slowly till
tender, which will be in thirty or forty minutes, according to
their size; when done drain them quite dry, pour a little melted
butter over them, sprinkle them with pepper and salt and serve
hot.</p>
<p>An excellent way to peel onions so as not to affect the eyes is
to take a pan <i>full</i> of water and hold and peel them under the
water.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 199]</span><a name='Page_199' id=
"Page_199"></a>
<p><b>ONIONS STEWED.</b></p>
<p>Cook the same as boiled onions, and, when quite done, turn off
all the water; add a teacupful of milk, a piece of butter the size
of an egg, pepper and salt to taste, a tablespoonful of flour
stirred to a cream; let all boil up once and serve in a vegetable
dish hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ONIONS BAKED.</b></p>
<p>Use the large Spanish onion, as best for this purpose; wash them
clean, but do not peel, and put into a saucepan with slightly
salted water; boil an hour, replacing the water with more boiling
hot as it evaporates; turn off the water and lay the onions on a
cloth to dry them well; roll each one in a piece of buttered tissue
paper, twisting it at the top to keep it on, and bake in a slow
oven about an hour, or until tender all through; peel them; place
in a deep dish and brown slightly, basting well with butter for
fifteen minutes; season with salt and pepper and pour some melted
butter over them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED ONIONS.</b></p>
<p>Peel, slice and fry them brown in equal quantities of butter and
lard or nice drippings; cover until partly soft, remove the cover
and brown them; salt and pepper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED ONIONS.</b></p>
<p>Take eight or ten onions of good size, slice them and boil until
tender. Lay them in a baking-dish, put in bread crumbs, butter in
small bits, pepper and salt, between each layer until the dish is
full, putting bread crumbs last; add milk or cream until full. Bake
twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
<p>A little onion is not an injurious article of food, as many
believe. A judicious use of plants of the onion family is quite as
important a factor in successful cookery as salt and pepper. When
carefully concealed by manipulation in food, it affords zest and
enjoyment to many who could not otherwise taste of it were its
presence known. A great many successful compounds derive their
excellence from the partly concealed flavor of the onion, which
imparts a delicate appetizing aroma highly prized by epicures.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 200]</span><a name='Page_200' id=

<p><b>CAULIFLOWER.</b></p>
<p>When cleaned and washed, drop them into boiling water, into
which you have put salt and a teaspoonful of flour, or a slice of
bread; boil till tender; take off, drain and dish them; serve with
a sauce spread over and made with melted butter, salt, pepper,
grated nutmeg, chopped parsley and vinegar.</p>
<p>Another way is to make a white sauce (see SAUCES) and when the
cauliflowers are dished as above, turn the white sauce over, and
serve warm. They may also be served in the same way with a milk,
cream, or tomato sauce, or with brown butter.</p>
<p>It is a very good plan to loosen the leaves of a head of
cauliflower and let lie, the top downward, in a pan of cold salt
water, to remove any insects that might be hidden between them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED CAULIFLOWER.</b></p>
<p>Boil the cauliflower till about half done. Mix two
tablespoonfuls of flour with two yolks of eggs, then add water
enough to make a rather thin paste; add salt to taste; the two
whites are beaten till stiff, and then mixed with the yolks, flour
and water. Dip each branch of the cauliflower into the mixture, and
fry them in hot fat. When done, take them off with a skimmer, turn
into a colander, dust salt all over and serve warm. Asparagus,
celery, egg-plant, oyster plant are all fine when fried in this
manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CABBAGE BOILED.</b></p>
<p>Great care is requisite in cleaning a cabbage for boiling, as it
frequently harbors numerous insects. The large drumhead cabbage
requires an hour to boil; the green savory cabbage will boil in
twenty minutes. Add considerable salt to the water when boiling. Do
not let a cabbage boil too long&mdash;by a long boiling it becomes
watery. Remove it from the water into a colander to drain and serve
with drawn butter, or butter poured over it.</p>
<p>Red cabbage is used for slaw, as is also the white winter
cabbage. For directions to prepare these varieties, see articles
SLAW and SOURCROUT.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CABBAGE WITH CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Remove the outer leaves from a solid, small-sized head of
cabbage, and cut the remainder as fine as for slaw. Have on the
fire a spider <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 201]</span><a name=
'Page_201' id="Page_201"></a>or deep skillet, and when it is hot
put in the cut cabbage, pouring over it right away a pint of
boiling water. Cover closely and allow it to cook rapidly for ten
minutes. Drain off the water and add half a pint of new milk, or
part milk and cream; when it boils, stir in a large teaspoonful of
either wheat or rice flour moistened with milk; add salt and
pepper, and as soon as it comes to a boil, serve. Those who find
slaw and other dishes prepared from cabbage indigestible will not
complain of this.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED CABBAGE.</b></p>
<p>Take a sound, solid cabbage, and with a large sharp knife shave
it <i>very fine</i>. Put it in a saucepan, pour in half a teacupful
of water, or just enough to keep it from burning; cover it very
tightly, so as to confine the steam; watch it closely, add a little
water now and then, until it begins to be tender; then put into it
a large tablespoonful of butter; salt and pepper to taste, dish it
hot. If you prefer to give it a tart taste, just before taking from
the fire add a third of a cup of good vinegar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LADIES' CABBAGE.</b></p>
<p>Boil a firm white cabbage fifteen minutes, changing the water
then for more from the boiling tea-kettle. When tender, drain and
set aside until perfectly cold. Chop fine and add two beaten eggs,
a tablespoonful of butter, pepper, salt, three tablespoonfuls of
rich milk or cream. Stir all well together, and bake in a buttered
pudding-dish until brown. Serve very hot. This dish resembles
cauliflower and is very digestible and palatable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED CABBAGE.</b></p>
<p>Place in a frying pan an ounce of butter and heat it boiling
hot. Then take cold boiled cabbage chopped fine, or cabbage hot,
cooked the same as steamed cabbage, put it into the hot butter and
fry a light brown, adding two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Very
good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH WAY OF COOKING CABBAGE.</b></p>
<p>Chop cold boiled white cabbage and let it drain till perfectly
dry: stir in some melted butter to taste; pepper, salt and four
tablespoonfuls of cream; after it is heated through add two
well-beaten eggs; then turn the mixture into a buttered frying pan,
stirring until it is very hot and becomes a delicate brown on the
under side. Place a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 202]</span><a name=
'Page_202' id="Page_202"></a>hot dish over the pan, which must be
reversed when turned out to be served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOURCROUT.</b></p>
<p>Barrels having held wine or vinegar are used to prepare
sourcrout in. It is better, however, to have a special barrel for
the purpose. Strasburg, as well as all Alsace, has a well-acquired
fame for preparing the cabbages. They slice very white and firm
cabbages in fine shreds with a machine made for the purpose. At the
bottom of a small barrel they place a layer of coarse salt and
alternately layers of cabbage and salt, being careful to have one
of salt on the top. As each layer of cabbage is added, it must be
pressed down by a large and heavy pestle and fresh layers are added
as soon as the juice floats on the surface. The cabbage must be
seasoned with a few grains of coriander, juniper berries, etc. When
the barrel is full it must be put in a dry cellar, covered with a
cloth, under a plank, and on this heavy weights are placed. At the
end of a few days it will begin to ferment, during which time the
pickle must be drawn off and replaced by fresh, until the liquor
becomes clear. This should be done every day. Renew the cloth and
wash the cover, put the weights back and let stand for a month. By
that time the sourcrout will be ready for use. Care must be taken
to let the least possible air enter the sourcrout and to have the
cover perfectly clean. Each time the barrel has to be opened it
must be properly closed again. These precautions must not be
neglected.</p>
<p>This is often fried in the same manner as fried cabbage,
excepting it is first boiled until soft in just water enough to
cook it, then fry and add vinegar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BOIL RICE.</b></p>
<p>Pick over the rice carefully, wash it in warm water, rubbing it
between the hands, rinsing it in several waters, then let it remain
in cold water until ready to be cooked. Have a saucepan of water
slightly salted; when it is boiling hard, pour off the cold water
from the rice, and sprinkle it in the boiling water by degrees, so
as to keep the particles separated. Boil it steadily for twenty
minutes, then take it off from the fire and drain off all the
water. Place the saucepan with the lid partly off, on the back part
of the stove, where it is only moderately warm, to allow the rice
to dry. The moisture will pass off and each grain of rice will be
separated, so that if shaken the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
203]</span><a name='Page_203' id="Page_203"></a>grains will fall
apart. This is the true way of serving rice as a vegetable and is
the mode of cooking it in the Southern States where it is
raised.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PARSNIPS, BOILED.</b></p>
<p>Wash, scrape and split them. Put them into a pot of boiling
water; add a little salt, and boil them till quite tender, which
will be in from two to three hours, according to their size. Dry
them in a cloth when done and pour melted butter or white sauce
(see SAUCES) over them in the dish. Serve them up with any sort of
boiled meat or with salt cod.</p>
<p>Parsnips are very good baked or stewed with meat.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED PARSNIPS.</b></p>
<p>Boil tender in a little hot water salted; scrape, cut into long
slices, dredge with flour; fry in hot lard or dripping, or in
butter and lard mixed; fry quite brown. Drain off fat and
serve.</p>
<p>Parsnips may be boiled and mashed the same as potatoes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED PARSNIPS.</b></p>
<p>After washing and scraping the parsnips slice them about half of
an inch thick. Put them in a saucepan of boiling water containing
just enough to barely cook them; add a tablespoonful of butter,
season with salt and pepper, then cover closely. Stew them until
the water has cooked away, watching carefully and stirring often to
prevent burning, until they are soft. When they are done they will
be of a creamy light straw color and deliciously sweet, retaining
all the goodness of the vegetable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PARSNIP FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Boil four or five parsnips; when tender take off the skin and
mash them fine; add to them a teaspoonful of wheat flour and a
beaten egg; put a tablespoonful of lard or beef drippings in a
frying pan over the fire, add to it a saltspoonful of salt; when
boiling hot put in the parsnips; make it in small cakes with a
spoon; when one side is a delicate brown turn the other; when both
are done take them on a dish, put a very little of the fat in which
they were fried over and serve hot. These resemble very nearly the
taste of the salsify or oyster plant, and will generally be
preferred.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 204]</span><a name='Page_204' id=
"Page_204"></a>
<p><b>CREAMED PARSNIPS.</b></p>
<p>Boil tender, scrape and slice lengthwise. Put over the fire with
two tablespoonfuls of butter, pepper and salt and a little minced
parsley. Shake until the mixture boils. Dish the parsnips, add to
the sauce three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk in which has been
stirred a quarter of a spoonful of flour. Boil once and pour over
the parsnips.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Pour boiling water over a dozen sound ripe tomatoes; let them
remain for a few moments; then peel off the skins, slice them and
put them over the fire in a well-lined tin or granite-ware
saucepan. Stew them about twenty minutes, then add a tablespoonful
of butter, salt and pepper to taste; let them stew fifteen minutes
longer and serve hot. Some prefer to thicken tomatoes with a little
grated bread, adding a teaspoonful of sugar; and others who like
the flavor of onion chop up one and add while stewing; then again,
some add as much green corn as there are tomatoes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO PEEL TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Put the tomatoes into a frying basket and plunge them into hot
water for three or four minutes. Drain and peel. Another way is to
place them in a flat baking-tin and set them in a hot oven about
five minutes; this loosens the skins so that they readily slip
off.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Butter the sides and bottom of a pudding-dish. Put a layer of
bread crumbs in the bottom; on them put a layer of sliced tomatoes;
sprinkle with salt, pepper and some bits of butter, and a very
<i>little</i> white sugar. Then repeat with another layer of
crumbs, another of tomato and seasoning until full, having the top
layer of slices of tomato, with bits of butter on each. Bake
covered until well cooked through; remove the cover and brown
quickly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STUFFED BAKED TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>From the blossom end of a dozen tomatoes&mdash;smooth, ripe and
solid&mdash;cut a thin slice and with a small spoon scoop out the
pulp without breaking the rind surrounding it; chop a small head of
cabbage and a good-sized onion fine and mix with them fine bread
crumbs <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 205]</span><a name='Page_205' id=
"Page_205"></a>and the pulp; season with pepper, salt and sugar and
add a cup of sweet cream; when all is well mixed, fill the tomato
shells, replace the slices and place the tomatoes in a buttered
baking-dish, cut ends up and put in the pan just enough water to
keep from burning; drop a small lump of butter on each tomato and
bake half an hour or so, till well done; place another bit of
butter on each and serve in same dish. Very fine.</p>
<p>Another stuffing which is considered quite fine. Cut a slice
from the stem of each and scoop out the soft pulp. Mince one small
onion and fry it slightly; add a gill of hot water, the tomato pulp
and two ounces of cold veal or chicken chopped fine, simmer slowly
and season with salt and pepper. Stir into the pan cracker dust or
bread crumbs enough to absorb the moisture; take off from the fire
and let it cool; stuff the tomatoes with this mass, sprinkle dry
crumbs over the top; add a small piece of butter to the top of each
and bake until slightly browned on top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED TOMATOES. (Plain.)</b></p>
<p>Peel and slice quarter of an inch thick; place in layers in a
pudding-dish, seasoning each layer with salt, pepper, butter and a
very little white sugar. Cover with a lid or large plate and bake
half an hour. Remove the lid and brown for fifteen minutes. Just
before taking from the oven pour over the top three or four
tablespoonfuls of whipped cream with melted butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO PREPARE TOMATOES. (Raw.)</b></p>
<p>Carefully remove the peelings. Only perfectly ripe tomatoes
should ever be eaten raw and if ripe the skins easily peel off.
Scalding injures the flavor. Slice them and sprinkle generously
with salt, more sparingly with black pepper, and to a dish holding
one quart, add a light tablespoonful of sugar to give a piquant
zest to the whole. Lastly, add a gill of best cider vinegar;
although, if you would have a dish yet better suited to please an
epicurean palate, you may add a teaspoonful of made mustard and two
tablespoonfuls of rich sweet cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED AND BROILED TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Cut firm, large, ripe tomatoes into thick slices, rather more
than a quarter of an inch thick. Season with salt and pepper,
dredge well <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 206]</span><a name='Page_206'
id="Page_206"></a>with flour, or roll in egg and crumbs, and fry
them brown on both sides evenly, in hot butter and lard mixed. Or,
prepare them the same as for frying, broiling on a well-greased
gridiron, seasoning afterward the same as beefsteak. A good
accompaniment to steak. Or, having prepared the following sauce, a
pint of milk, a tablespoonful of flour and one beaten egg, salt,
pepper and a very little mace; cream an ounce of butter, whisk into
it the milk and let it simmer until it thickens; pour the sauce on
a hot side-dish and arrange the tomatoes in the centre.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCRAMBLED TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Remove the skins from a dozen tomatoes; cut them up in a
saucepan; add a little butter, pepper and salt; when sufficiently
boiled, beat up five or six eggs and just before you serve turn
them into the saucepan with the tomatoes, and stir one way for two
minutes, allowing them time to be done thoroughly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUCUMBER &Aacute; LA CR&Ecirc;ME.</b></p>
<p>Peel and cut into slices (lengthwise) some fine cucumbers. Boil
them until soft; salt to taste, and serve with delicate cream
sauce. For Tomato Salad, see SALADS, also for Raw Cucumbers.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED CUCUMBERS.</b></p>
<p>Pare them and cut lengthwise in very thick slices; wipe them dry
with a cloth; sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and
fry in lard and butter, a tablespoonful of each mixed. Brown both
sides and serve warm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN CORN, BOILED.</b></p>
<p>This should be cooked on the same day it is gathered; it loses
its sweetness in a few hours and must be artificially supplied.
Strip off the husks, pick out all the silk and put it in boiling
water; if not entirely fresh, add a tablespoonful of sugar to the
water, but <i>no salt</i>; boil twenty minutes, fast, and serve; or
you may cut it from the cob, put in plenty of butter and a little
salt, and serve in a covered vegetable dish. The corn is much
sweeter when cooked with the husks on, but requires longer time to
boil. Will generally boil in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Green corn left over from dinner makes a nice breakfast dish,
prepared as follows: Cut the corn from the cob, and put into a bowl
with a cup of milk to every cup of corn, a half cup of flour, one
egg, a pinch of salt, and a little butter. Mix well into a thick
batter, and fry in small cakes in very hot butter. Serve with
plenty of butter and powdered sugar.</p>

<p><b>CORN PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>This is a Virginia dish. Scrape the substance out of twelve ears
of tender, green, uncooked corn (it is better scraped than grated,
as you do not get those husky particles which you cannot avoid with
a grater); add yolks and whites, beaten separately, of four eggs, a
teaspoonful of sugar, the same of flour mixed in a tablespoonful of
butter, a small quantity of salt and pepper, and one pint of milk.
Bake about half or three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED CORN.</b></p>
<p>Take a dozen ears of green sweet corn, very tender and juicy;
cut off the kernels, cutting with a large sharp knife from the top
of the cob down; then scrape the cob. Put the corn in a saucepan
over the fire with just enough water to make it cook without
burning; boil about twenty minutes, then add a teacupful of milk or
cream, a tablespoonful of cold butter, and season with pepper and
salt. Boil ten minutes longer and dish up hot in a vegetable dish.
The corn would be much sweeter if the scraped cobs were boiled
first in the water that the corn is cooked in.</p>
<p>Many like corn cooked in this manner, putting half corn and half
tomatoes; either way is very good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED CORN.</b></p>
<p>Cut the corn off the cob, taking care not to bring off any of
the husk with it and to have the grains as separate as possible.
Fry in a little butter&mdash;just enough to keep it from sticking
to the pan; stir very often. When nicely browned, add salt and
pepper and a little rich cream. Do not set it near the stove after
the cream is added, as it will be apt to turn. This makes a nice
dinner or breakfast dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROASTED GREEN CORN.</b></p>
<p>Strip off all the husk from green corn and roast it on a
gridiron over a bright fire of coals, turning it as one side is
done. Or, if a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 208]</span><a name=
'Page_208' id="Page_208"></a>wood fire is used, make a place clean
in front of the fire, lay the corn down, turn it when one side is
done; serve with salt and butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUCCOTASH.</b></p>
<p>Take a pint of fresh shelled Lima beans, or any large fresh
beans, put them in a pot with cold water, rather more than will
cover them. Scrape the kernels from twelve ears of young sweet
corn; put the cobs in with the beans, boiling from half to
three-quarters of an hour. Now take out the cobs and put in the
scraped corn; boil again fifteen minutes, then season with salt and
pepper to taste, a piece of butter the size of an egg and half a
cup of cream. Serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED EGG-PLANT.</b></p>
<p>Take fresh, purple egg-plants of a middling size; cut them in
slices a quarter of an inch thick, and soak them for half an hour
in cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it. Have ready some
cracker or bread crumbs and one beaten egg; drain off the water
from the slices, lay them on a napkin, dip them in the crumbs and
then in the egg, put another coat of crumbs on them and fry them in
butter to a light brown. The frying pan must be hot before the
slices are put in&mdash;they will fry in ten minutes.</p>
<p>You may pare them before you put them into the frying pan, or
you may pull off the skins when you take them up. You must not
remove them from the water until you are ready to cook them, as the
air will turn them black.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STUFFED EGG-PLANT.</b></p>
<p>Cut the egg-plant in two; scrape out all the inside and put it
in a saucepan with a little minced ham; cover with water and boil
until soft; drain off the water; add two tablespoonfuls of grated
crumbs, a tablespoonful of butter, half a minced onion, salt and
pepper; stuff each half of the hull with the mixture; add a small
lump of butter to each and bake fifteen minutes. Minced veal or
chicken in the place of ham, is equally as good and many prefer
it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STRING BEANS.</b></p>
<p>Break off the end that grew to the vine, drawing off at the same
time the string upon the edge; repeat the same process from the
other <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 209]</span><a name='Page_209' id=
"Page_209"></a>end; cut them with a sharp knife into pieces half an
inch long, and boil them in <i>just enough</i> water to
<i>cover</i> them. They usually require one hour's boiling; but
this depends upon their age and freshness. After they have boiled
until tender and the water <i>boiled nearly out</i>, add pepper and
salt, a tablespoonful of butter and a half a cup of cream; if you
have not the cream add more butter.</p>
<p>Many prefer to drain them before adding the seasoning; in that
case they lose the real goodness of the vegetable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LIMA AND KIDNEY BEANS.</b></p>
<p>These beans should be put into boiling water, a little more than
enough to cover them, and boiled till tender&mdash;from half an
hour to two hours; serve with butter and salt upon them.</p>
<p>These beans are in season from the last of July to the last of
September. There are several other varieties of beans used as
summer vegetables, which are cooked as above.</p>
<p>For Baked Beans, see PORK AND BEANS.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CELERY.</b></p>
<p>This is stewed the same as green corn, by boiling, adding cream,
butter, salt and pepper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED SALSIFY OR OYSTER-PLANT.</b></p>
<p>Wash the roots and scrape off their skins, throwing them, as you
do so, into cold water, for exposure to the air causes them to
immediately turn dark. Then cut crosswise into little thin slices;
throw into fresh water, enough to cover; add a little salt and stew
in a covered vessel until tender, or about one hour. Pour off a
little of the water, add a small lump of butter, a little pepper,
and a gill of sweet cream and a teaspoonful of flour stirred to a
paste. Boil up and serve hot.</p>
<p>Salsify may be simply boiled and melted butter turned over
them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED SALSIFY.</b></p>
<p>Stew the salsify as usual till very tender; then with the back
of a spoon or a potato jammer mash it very fine. Beat up an egg,
add a teacupful of milk, a little flour, butter and seasoning of
pepper and salt. Make into little cakes, and fry a light brown in
boiling lard.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 210]</span><a name='Page_210' id=
"Page_210"></a>
<p><b>BEETS BOILED.</b></p>
<p>Select small-sized, smooth roots. They should be carefully
washed, but not cut before boiling, as the juice will escape and
the sweetness of the vegetable be impaired, leaving it white and
hard. Put them into boiling water, and boil them until tender,
which requires often from one to two hours. Do not probe them, but
press them with the finger to ascertain if they are sufficiently
done. When satisfied of this, take them up, and put them into a pan
of cold water, and slip off the outside. Cut them into thin slices,
and while hot season with butter, salt, a little pepper and very
sharp vinegar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED BEETS.</b></p>
<p>Beets retain their sugary, delicate flavor to perfection if they
are baked instead of boiled. Turn them frequently while in the
oven, using a knife, as the fork allows the juice to run out. When
done remove the skin, and serve with butter, salt and pepper on the
slices.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED BEETS.</b></p>
<p>Boil them first and then scrape and slice them. Put them into a
stewpan with a piece of butter rolled in flour, some boiled onion
and parsley chopped fine, and a little vinegar, salt and pepper.
Set the pan on the fire, and let the beets stew for a quarter of an
hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OKRA.</b></p>
<p>This grows in the shape of pods, and is of a gelatinous
character, much used for soup, and is also pickled; it may be
boiled as follows: Put the young and tender pods of long white okra
in salted boiling water in granite, porcelain or a tin-lined
saucepan&mdash;as contact with Iron will discolor it; boil fifteen
minutes; remove the stems, and serve with butter, pepper, salt and
vinegar if preferred.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ASPARAGUS.</b></p>
<p>Scrape the stems of the asparagus lightly, but very clean; throw
them into cold water and when they are all scraped and very clean,
tie them in bunches of equal size; cut the large ends evenly, that
the stems may be all of the same length, and put the asparagus into
plenty of boiling water, well salted. While it is boiling, cut
several slices of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 211]</span><a name=
'Page_211' id="Page_211"></a>bread half an inch thick, pare off the
crust and toast it a delicate brown on both sides. When the stalks
of the asparagus are tender (it will usually cook in twenty to
forty minutes) lift it out directly, or it will lose both its color
and flavor and will also be liable to break; dip the toast quickly
into the liquor in which it was boiled and dish the vegetable upon
it, the heads all lying one way. Pour over white sauce, or melted
butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ASPARAGUS WITH EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Boil a bunch of asparagus twenty minutes; cut off the tender
tops and lay them in a deep-pie plate, buttering, salting and
peppering well. Beat up four eggs, the yolks and whites separately
to a stiff froth; add two tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, a
tablespoonful of warm butter, pepper and salt to taste. Pour evenly
over the asparagus mixture. Bake eight minutes or until the eggs
are set. Very good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN PEAS.</b></p>
<p>Shell the peas and wash in cold water. Put in boiling water just
enough to cover them well and keep them from burning; boil from
twenty minutes to half an hour, when the liquor should be nearly
boiled out; season with pepper and salt and a good allowance of
butter; serve very hot.</p>
<p>This is a very much better way than cooking in a larger quantity
of water and draining off the liquor, as that diminishes the
sweetness, and much of the fine flavor of the peas is lost. The
salt should never be put in the peas before they are tender, unless
very young, as it tends to harden them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED GREEN PEAS.</b></p>
<p>Into a saucepan of boiling water put two or three pints of young
green peas and when nearly done and tender drain in a colander dry;
then melt two ounces of butter in two of flour; stir well and boil
five minutes longer; should the pods be quite clean and fresh boil
them first in the water, remove and put in the peas. The Germans
prepare a very palatable dish of sweet young pods alone by simply
stirring in a little butter with some savory herbs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SQUASHES, OR CYMBLINGS.</b></p>
<p>The green or summer squash is best when the outside is beginning
to turn yellow, as it is then less watery and insipid than when
younger. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 212]</span><a name='Page_212'
id="Page_212"></a>Wash them, cut them into pieces and take out the
seeds. Boil them about three-quarters of an hour, or till quite
tender. When done, drain and squeeze them well till you have
pressed out all the water; mash them with a little butter, pepper
and salt. Then put the squash thus prepared into a stewpan, set it
on hot coals and stir it very frequently till it becomes dry. Take
care not to let it burn.</p>
<p>Summer squash is very nice steamed, then prepared the same as
boiled.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED WINTER SQUASH.</b></p>
<p>This is much finer than the summer squash. It is fit to eat in
August, and, in a dry warm place, can be kept well all winter. The
color is a very bright yellow. Pare it, take out the seeds, cut it
in pieces, and stew it slowly till quite soft in a very little
water. Afterwards drain, squeeze and press it well; then mash it
with a very little butter, pepper and salt. They will boil in from
twenty to forty minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED WINTER SQUASH.</b></p>
<p>Cut open the squash, take out the seeds and without paring cut
it up into large pieces; put the pieces on tins or in a
dripping-pan, place in a moderately hot oven and bake about an
hour. When done, peel and mash like mashed potatoes, or serve the
pieces hot on a dish, to be eaten warm with butter like sweet
potatoes. It retains its sweetness much better baked this way than
when boiled.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEGETABLE HASH.</b></p>
<p>Chop rather coarsely the remains of vegetables left from a
boiled dinner, such as cabbage, parsnips, potatoes, etc.; sprinkle
over them a little pepper, place in a saucepan or frying pan over
the fire; put in a piece of butter the size of a hickory nut; when
it begins to melt, tip the dish so as to oil the bottom and around
the sides; then put in the chopped vegetables, pour in a spoonful
or two of hot water from the tea-kettle, cover quickly so as to
keep in the steam. When heated thoroughly take off the cover and
stir occasionally until well cooked. Serve hot. Persons fond of
vegetables will relish this dish very much.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPINACH.</b></p>
<p>It should be cooked so as to retain its bright green color and
not sent to table, as it so often is, of a dull brown or olive
color; to retain its fresh appearance, do not cover the vessel
while it is cooking.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 213]</span><a name='Page_213' id=
"Page_213"></a>
<p>Spinach requires dose examination and picking, as insects are
frequently found among it and it is often gritty. Wash it through
three or four waters. Then drain it and put it in boiling water.
Fifteen to twenty minutes is generally sufficient time to boil
spinach. Be careful to remove the scum. When it is quite tender,
take it up, and drain and squeeze it well. Chop it fine, and put it
into a saucepan with a piece of butter and a little pepper and
salt. Set it on the fire and let it stew five minutes, stirring it
all the time, until quite dry. Turn it into a vegetable dish, shape
it into a mound, slice some hard-boiled eggs and lay around the
top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREENS.</b></p>
<p>About a peck of greens are enough for a mess for a family of
six, such as dandelions, cowslips, burdock, chicory and other
greens. All greens should be carefully examined, the tough ones
thrown out, then be thoroughly washed through several waters until
they are entirely free from sand. The addition of a handful of salt
to each pan of water used in washing the greens will free them from
insects and worms, especially if after the last watering they are
allowed to stand in salted water for a half hour or longer. When
ready to boil the greens, put them into a large pot half full of
boiling water, with a handful of salt, and boil them steadily until
the stalks are tender; this will be in from five to twenty minutes,
according to the maturity of the greens; but remember that
long-continued boiling wastes the tender substances of the leaves,
and so diminishes both the bulk and the nourishment of the dish;
for this reason it is best to cut away any tough stalks before
beginning to cook the greens. As soon as they are tender drain them
in a colander, chop them a little and return them to the fire long
enough to season them with salt, pepper and butter; vinegar may be
added if it is liked; the greens should be served as soon as they
are hot.</p>
<p>All kinds of greens can be cooked in this manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED CARROTS.</b></p>
<p>Wash and scrape the carrots and divide them into strips; put
them into a stewpan with water enough to cover them; add a spoonful
of salt and let them boil slowly until tender; then drain and
replace them in the pan, with two tablespoons of butter rolled in
flour, shake over a little pepper and salt, then add enough cream
or milk to moisten the whole; let it come to a boil and serve
hot.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 214]</span><a name='Page_214' id=
"Page_214"></a>
<p><b>CARROTS MASHED.</b></p>
<p>Scrape and wash them; cook them tender in boiling water salted
slightly. Drain well and mash them. Work in a good piece of butter
and season with pepper and salt. Heap up on a vegetable dish and
serve hot.</p>
<p>Carrots are also good simply boiled in salted water and dished
up hot with melted butter over them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TURNIPS.</b></p>
<p>Turnips are boiled plain with or without meat, also mashed like
potatoes and stewed like parsnips. They should always be served
hot. They require from forty minutes to an hour to cook.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED PUMPKINS.</b></p>
<p>See stewed pumpkin for pie. Cook the same, then after stewing
season the same as mashed potatoes. Pumpkin is good baked in the
same manner as baked winter squash.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED ENDIVE.</b></p>
<p><i>Ingredients.</i>&mdash;Six heads of endive, salt and water,
one pint of broth, thickening of butter and flour, one
tablespoonful of lemon juice, a small lump of sugar.</p>
<p><i>Mode.</i>&mdash;Wash and free the endive thoroughly from
insects, remove the green part of the leaves, and put it into
boiling water, slightly salted. Let it remain for ten minutes; then
take it out, drain it till there is no water remaining and chop it
very fine. Put it into a stewpan with the broth, add a little salt
and a lump of sugar, and boil until the endive is perfectly tender.
When done, which may be ascertained by squeezing a piece between
the thumb and finger, add a thickening of butter and flour and the
lemon juice; let the sauce boil up and serve.</p>
<p><i>Time.</i>&mdash;Ten minutes to boil, five minutes to simmer
in the broth.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED MUSHROOMS.</b></p>
<p>Prepare them the same as for stewing. Place them in a baking-pan
in a moderate oven. Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice and
chopped parsley. Cook in the oven fifteen minutes, baste with
butter. Arrange on a dish and pour the gravy over them. Serve with
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 215]</span><a name='Page_215' id=
"Page_215"></a>sauce made by heating a cup of cream, two ounces of
butter, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a little cayenne
pepper, salt, a tablespoonful of white sauce and two tablespoonfuls
of lemon juice. Put in a saucepan and set on the fire. Stir until
thick, but do not let boil. Mushrooms are very nice placed on
slices of well-buttered toast when set into the oven to bake. They
cook in about fifteen minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED MUSHROOMS.</b></p>
<p>Time, twenty-one minutes. Button mushrooms, salt to taste, a
little butter rolled in flour, two tablespoonfuls of cream or the
yolk of one egg. Choose buttons of uniform size. Wipe them clean
and white with a wet flannel; put them in a stewpan with a little
water and let them stew very gently for a quarter of an hour. Add
salt to taste, work in a little flour and butter, to make the
liquor about as thick as cream, and let it boil for five minutes.
When you are ready to dish it up, stir in two tablespoonfuls of
cream or the yolk of an egg; stir it over the fire for a minute,
but do not let it boil, and serve. Stewed button mushrooms are very
nice, either in fish stews or ragouts, or served apart to eat with
fish. Another way of doing them is to stew them in milk and water
(after they are rubbed white), add to them a little veal gravy,
mace and salt and thicken the gravy with cream or the yolks of
eggs.</p>
<p>Mushrooms can be cooked in the same manner as the recipes for
oysters, either stewed, fried, broiled, or as a soup. They are also
used to flavor sauces, catsups, meat gravies, game and soups.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED MUSHROOMS.</b></p>
<p>Canned mushrooms may be served with good effect with game and
even with beefsteak if prepared in this way: Open the can and pour
off every drop of the liquid found there; let the mushrooms drain,
then put them in a saucepan with a little cream and butter, pepper
and salt; let them simmer gently for from five to ten minutes, and
when the meat is on the platter pour the mushrooms over it. If
served with steak, that should be very tender and be broiled, never
in any case fried.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUSHROOMS FOR WINTER USE.</b></p>
<p>Wash and wipe free from grit the small fresh button mushrooms.
Put into a frying pan a quarter of a pound of the very best butter.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 216]</span><a name='Page_216' id=
"Page_216"></a>Add to it two whole cloves, a saltspoonful of salt
and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. When hot add a quart of the
small mushrooms, toss them about in the butter for a moment only,
then put them in jars; fill the top of each jar with an inch or two
of the butter and let it cool. Keep the jars in a cool place, and
when the butter is quite firm add a top layer of salt. Cover to
keep out dust.</p>
<p>The best mushrooms grow on uplands or in high open fields, where
the air is pure.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TRUFFLES.</b></p>
<p>The truffle belongs to the family of the mushrooms; they are
used principally in this country as a condiment for boned turkey
and chicken, scrambled eggs, fillets of beef, game and fish. When
mixed in due proportion, they add a peculiar zest and flavor to
sauces that cannot be found in any other plant in the vegetable
kingdom.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ITALIAN STYLE OF DRESSING TRUFFLES.</b></p>
<p>Ten truffles, a quarter of a pint of salad oil, pepper and salt
to taste, one tablespoonful of minced parsley, a very little finely
minced garlic, two blades of pounded mace, one tablespoonful of
lemon juice.</p>
<p>After cleansing and brushing the truffles, cut them into thin
slices and put them in a baking-dish, on a seasoning of oil or
butter, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic and mace in the above
proportion. Bake them for nearly an hour, and just before serving
add the lemon juice and send them to the table very hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TRUFFLES AU NATUREL.</b></p>
<p>Select some fine truffles; cleanse them by washing them in
several waters with a brush until not a particle of sand or grit
remains on them; wrap each truffle in buttered paper and bake in a
hot oven for quite an hour; take off the paper; wipe the truffles
and serve them in a hot napkin.</p>

ounce of grated cheese; when the cheese is melted, dish. Put
alternate layers of macaroni and cheese, then turn over the soup
stock and bake half an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MACARONI AND CHEESE.</b></p>
<p>Break half a pound of macaroni into pieces an inch or two long;
cook it in boiling water, enough to cover it well; put in a good
teaspoonful of salt; let it boil about twenty minutes. Drain it
well and then put a layer in the bottom of a well-buttered
pudding-dish; upon this some grated cheese and small pieces of
butter, a bit of salt, then more macaroni, and so on, filling the
dish; sprinkle the top layer with a thick layer of cracker crumbs.
Pour over the whole a teacupful of cream or milk. Set it in the
oven and bake half an hour. It should be nicely browned on top.
Serve in the same dish in which it was baked with a clean napkin
pinned around it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TIMBALE OF MACARONI.</b></p>
<p>Break in very short lengths small macaroni (vermicelli,
spaghetti, tagliarini). Let it be rather overdone; dress it with
butter and grated cheese; then work into it one or two eggs,
according to quantity. Butter and bread crumb a plain mold, and
when the macaroni is nearly cold fill the mold with it, pressing it
well down and leaving a hollow in the centre, into which place a
well-flavored mince of meat, poultry or game; then fill up the mold
with more macaroni, pressed well down. Bake in a moderately heated
oven, turn out and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MACARONI &Aacute; LA CR&Ecirc;ME.</b></p>
<p>Boil one-quarter of a pound of macaroni in plenty of hot water,

and when it boils stir into it a mixture of two tablespoonfuls of
butter and one of flour. Add two tablespoonfuls of cream, a little
white and cayenne pepper; salt to taste, and from one-quarter to
one-half a pound of grated cheese, according to taste. Drain and
dish the macaroni; pour the boiling sauce over it and serve
immediately.</p>

<h2>BUTTER AND CHEESE</h2>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE BUTTER.</b></p>
<p>Thoroughly scald the churn, then cool well with ice or spring
water. Now pour in the thick cream; churn fast at first, then, as
the butter forms, more slowly; always with perfect regularity; in
warm weather, pour a little cold water into the churn, should the
butter form slowly; in the winter, if the cream is too cold, add a
little warm water to bring it to the proper temperature. When the
butter has "come", rinse the sides of the churn down with cold
water and take the butter up with a perforated dasher or a wooden
ladle, turning it dexterously just below the surface of the
buttermilk to catch every stray bit; have ready some very cold
water in a deep wooden tray; and into this plunge the dasher when
you draw it from the churn; the butter will float off, leaving the
dasher free. When you have collected all the butter, gather behind
a wooden butter ladle and drain off the water, squeezing and
pressing the butter with the ladle; then pour on more cold water
and work the butter with the ladle to get the milk out, drain off
the water, sprinkle salt over the butter&mdash;a tablespoonful to a
pound; work it in a little and set in a cool place for an hour to
harden, then work and knead it until not another drop of water
exudes, and the butter is perfectly smooth, and close in texture
and polish; then with the ladle make up into rolls, little balls,
stamped pats, etc.</p>
<p>The churn, dasher, tray and ladle should be well scalded before
using, so that the butter will not stick to them, and then cooled
with very cold water.</p>
<p>When you skim cream into your cream jar, stir it well into what
is already there, so that it may all sour alike; and no <i>fresh
cream should be put with it</i> within twelve hours before
churning, or the butter will not come quickly; and perhaps, not at
all.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 220]</span><a name='Page_220' id=
"Page_220"></a>
<p>Butter is indispensable in almost all culinary preparations.
Good fresh butter, used in moderation, is easily digested; it is
softening, nutritious and fattening, and is far more easily
digested than any other of the oleaginous substances sometimes used
in its place.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE BUTTER QUICKLY.</b></p>
<p>Immediately after the cow is milked, strain the milk into clean
pans, and set it over a moderate fire until it is scalding hot; do
not let it boil; then set it aside; when it is cold, skim off the
cream; the milk will still be fit for any ordinary use; when you
have enough cream put it into a clean earthen basin; beat it with a
wooden spoon until the butter is made, which will not be long; then
take it from the milk and work it with a little cold water, until
it is free from milk; then drain off the water, put a small
tablespoonful of fine salt to each pound of butter and work it in.
A small teaspoonful of fine white sugar, worked in with the salt,
will be found an improvement&mdash;sugar is a great preservative.
Make the butter in a roll; cover it with a bit of muslin and keep
it in a cool place. A reliable recipe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A BRINE TO PRESERVE BUTTER.</b></p>
<p>First work your butter into small rolls, wrapping each one
carefully in a clean muslin cloth, tying them up with a string.
Make a brine, say three gallons, having it strong enough of salt to
bear up an egg; add half a teacupful of pure, white sugar, and one
tablespoonful of saltpetre; boil the brine, and when cold strain it
carefully. Pour it over the rolls so as to more than cover them, as
this excludes the air. Place a weight over all to keep the rolls
under the surface.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PUTTING UP BUTTER TO KEEP.</b></p>
<p>Take of the best pure common salt two quarts, one ounce of white
sugar and one of saltpetre; pulverize them together completely.
Work the butter well, then thoroughly work in an ounce of this
mixture to every pound of butter. The butter is to be made into
half-pound rolls, and put into the following brine&mdash;to three
gallons of brine strong enough to bear an egg, add a quarter of a
pound of white sugar.</p>

<p><b>CURDS AND CREAM.</b></p>
<p>One gallon of milk will make a moderate dish. Put one spoonful
of prepared rennet to each quart of milk, and when you find that it
has become curd, tie it loosely in a thin cloth and hang it to
drain; do not wring or press the cloth; when drained, put the curd
into a mug and set in cool water, which must be frequently changed
(a refrigerator saves this trouble). When you dish it, if there is
whey in the mug, lie it gently out without pressing the curd; lay
it on a deep dish, and pour fresh cream over it; have powdered
loaf-sugar to eat with it; also hand the nutmeg grater.</p>
<p>Prepared rennet can be had at almost any druggist's, and at a
reasonable price.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NEW JERSEY CREAM CHEESE.</b></p>
<p>First scald the quantity of milk desired; let it cool a little,
then add the rennet; the directions for quantity are given on the
packages of "Prepared Rennet." When the curd is formed, take it out
on a ladle without breaking it; lay it on a thin cloth held by two
persons; dash a ladleful of water over each ladleful of curd, to
separate the curd; hang it up to drain the water off, and then put
it under a light press for one hour; cut the curd with a thread
into small pieces; lay a cloth between each two, and press for an
hour; take them out, rub them with fine salt, let them lie on a
board for an hour, and wash them in cold water; let them lie to
drain, and in a day or two the skin will look dry; put some sweet
grass under and over them, and they will soon ripen.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COTTAGE CHEESE.</b></p>
<p>Put a pan of sour or loppered milk on the stove or range where
it is not too hot; let it scald until the whey rises to the top (be
careful that it does not boil, or the curd will become hard and
tough). Place a clean doth or towel over a sieve and pour this whey
and curd into it, living it covered to drain two or three hours;
then put it into a dish and chop it fine with a spoon, adding a
teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of butter and enough sweet
cream to make the cheese the consistency of putty. With your hands
make it into little balls flattened. Keep it in a cool place. Many
like it made rather thin with cream, serving it in a deep dish. You
may make this cheese of sweet milk by forming the curd with
prepared rennet.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 222]</span><a name='Page_222' id=
"Page_222"></a>
<p><b>SLIP.</b></p>
<p>Slip is bonny-clabber without its acidity, and so delicate is
its flavor that many persons like it just as well as ice cream. It
is prepared thus:&mdash;Make a quart of milk moderately warm; then
stir into it one large spoonful of the preparation called rennet;
set it by, and when cool again it will be as stiff as jelly. It
should be made only a few hours before it is to be used, or it will
be tough and watery; in summer set the dish on ice after it has
jellied. It must be served with powdered sugar, nutmeg and
cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHEESE FONDU.</b></p>
<p>Melt an ounce of butter and whisk into it a pint of boiled milk.
Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of flour in a gill of cold milk, add it
to the boiled milk and let it cool. Beat the yolks of four eggs
with a heaping teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper
and five ounces of grated cheese. Whip the whites of the eggs and
add them, pour the mixture into a deep tin lined with buttered
paper, and allow for the rising, say four inches. Bake twenty
minutes and serve the moment it leaves the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHEESE SOUFFL&Eacute;.</b></p>
<p>Melt an ounce of butter in a saucepan; mix smoothly with it one
ounce of flour, a pinch of salt and cayenne and a quarter of a pint
of milk; simmer the mixture gently over the fire, stirring it all
the time, till it is as thick as melted butter, stir into it about
three ounces of finely-grated parmesan, or any good cheese. Turn it
into a basin and mix with it the yolks of two well-beaten eggs.
Whisk three whites to a solid froth, and just before the souffle is
baked put them into it, and pour the mixture into a small round
tin. It should be only half filled, as the fondu will rise very
high. Pin a napkin around the dish in which it is baked, and serve
the moment it is baked. It would be well to have a metal cover
strongly heated. Time twenty minutes. Sufficient for six
persons.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED CHEESE.</b></p>
<p>Any person who is fond of cheese could not fail to favor this
recipe.</p>
<p>Take three slices of bread well-buttered, first cutting off the
brown outside crust. Grate fine a quarter of a pound of any kind of
good <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 223]</span><a name='Page_223' id=
"Page_223"></a>cheese; lay the bread in layers in a buttered
baking-dish, sprinkle over it the grated cheese, some salt and
pepper to taste. Mix four well-beaten eggs with three cups of milk;
pour it over the bread and cheese. Bake it in a hot oven as you
would cook a bread pudding. This makes an ample dish for four
people.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PASTRY RAMAKINS.</b></p>
<p>Take the remains or odd pieces of any light puff paste left from
pies or tarts; gather up the pieces of paste, roll it out evenly,
and sprinkle it with grated cheese of a nice flavor. Fold the paste
in three, roll it out again, and sprinkle more cheese over; fold
the paste, roll it out, and with a paste-cutter shape it in any way
that may be desired. Bake the ramakins in a brisk oven from ten to
fifteen minutes; dish them on a hot napkin and serve quickly. The
appearance of this dish may be very much improved by brushing the
ramakins over with yolk of egg before they are placed in the oven.
Where expense is not objected to, parmesan is the best kind of
cheese to use for making this dish.</p>
<p>Very nice with a cup of coffee for a lunch.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CAYENNE CHEESE STRAWS.</b></p>
<p>A quarter of a pound of flour, two ounces butter, two ounces
grated parmesan cheese, a pinch of salt and a few grains of cayenne
pepper. Mix into a paste with the yolk of an egg. Roll out to the
thickness of a silver quarter, about four or five inches long; cut
into strips about a third of an inch wide, twist them as you would
a paper spill and lay them on a baking-sheet slightly floured. Bake
in a moderate oven until crisp, but they must not be the least
brown. If put away in a tin these straws will keep a long time.
Serve cold, piled tastefully on a glass dish. You can make the
straws of remnants of puff pastry, rolling in the grated
cheese.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHEESE CREAM TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Stale bread may be served as follows: Toast the slices and cover
them slightly with grated cheese; make a cream for ten slices out
of a pint of milk and two tablespoonfuls of plain flour. The milk
should be boiling, and the flour mixed in a little cold water
before stirring in. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 224]</span><a name=
'Page_224' id="Page_224"></a>When the cream is nicely cooked,
season with salt and butter; set the toast and cheese in the oven
for three or four minutes and then pour the cream over them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WELSH RAREBIT.</b></p>
<p>Grate three ounces of dry cheese and mix it with the yolks of
two eggs, put four ounces of grated bread and three of butter; beat
the whole together in a mortar with a dessertspoonful of made
mustard, a little salt and some pepper; toast some slices of bread,
cut off the outside crust, cut it in shapes and spread the paste
thick upon them, and put them in the oven, let them become hot and
slightly browned, serve hot as possible.</p>

<h2><b>EGGS AND OMELETS.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>There are so many ways of cooking and dressing eggs, that it
seems unnecessary for the ordinary family to use those that are not
the most practical.</p>
<p>To ascertain the freshness of an egg, hold it between your thumb
and forefinger in a horizontal position, with a strong light in
front of you. The fresh egg will have a clear appearance, both
upper and lower sides being the same. The stale egg will have a
clear appearance at the lower side, while the upper side will
exhibit a dark or cloudy appearance.</p>
<p>Another test is to put them in a pan of cold water; those that
are the first to sink are the freshest; the stale will rise and
float on top; or, if the large end turns up in the water, they are
not fresh. The best time for preserving eggs is from July to
September.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO PRESERVE EGGS.</b></p>
<p>There are several recipes for preserving eggs and we give first
one which we know to be effectual, keeping them fresh from August
until Spring. Take a piece of quick-lime as large as a good-sized
lemon and two teacupfuls of salt; put it into a large vessel and
slack it with a gallon of boiling water. It will boil and bubble
until thick as cream; when it is cold, pour off the top, which will
be perfectly clear. Drain off this liquor, and pour it over your
eggs; see that the liquor more than covers them. A stone jar is the
most convenient&mdash;one that holds about six quarts.</p>
<p>Another manner of preserving eggs is to pack them in a jar with
layers of salt between, the large end of the egg downward, with a
thick layer of salt at the top; cover tightly and set in a cool
place.</p>
<p>Some put them in a wire basket or a piece of mosquito net and
dip them in boiling water half a minute; then pack in sawdust.
Still <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 226]</span><a name='Page_226' id=
"Page_226"></a>another manner is to dissolve a cheap article of gum
arabic, about as thin as muscilage, and brush over each egg with
it; then pack in powdered charcoal; set in a cool, dark place.</p>
<p>Eggs can be kept for some time by smearing the shells with
butter or lard; then packed in plenty of bran or sawdust, the eggs
not allowed to touch one another; or coat the eggs with melted
paraffine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after
they are laid; but rather a longer time should be allowed for
boiling a new-laid egg than for one that is three or four days old.
Have ready a saucepan of boiling water; put the eggs into it gently
with a spoon, letting the spoon touch the bottom of the saucepan
before it is withdrawn, that the egg may not fall and consequently
crack. For those who like eggs lightly boiled, three minutes will
be found sufficient; three and three-quarters to four minutes will
be ample time to set the white nicely; and if liked hard, six or
seven minutes will not be found too long. Should the eggs be
unusually large, as those of black Spanish fowls sometimes are,
allow an extra half minute for them. Eggs for salad should be
boiled for ten or fifteen minutes, and should be placed in a basin
of cold water for a few minutes to shrink the meat from the shell;
they should then be rolled on the table with the hand and the shell
will peel off easily.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOFT BOILED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>When properly cooked eggs are done evenly through, like any
other food. This result may be obtained by putting the eggs into a
dish with a cover, or a tin pail, and then pouring upon them
<i>boiling</i> water&mdash;two quarts or more to a dozen of
eggs&mdash;and cover and set them away where they will keep
<i>hot</i> and <i>not</i> boil for ten to twelve minutes. The heat
of the water cooks the eggs slowly, evenly and sufficiently,
leaving the centre or yolk harder than the white, and the egg
tastes as much richer and nicer as a fresh egg is nicer than a
stale egg.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCALLOPED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Hard-boil twelve eggs; slice them thin in rings; in the bottom
of a large well-buttered baking-dish place a layer of grated bread
crumbs, then one of eggs; cover with bits of butter and sprinkle
with pepper <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 227]</span><a name='Page_227'
id="Page_227"></a>and salt. Continue thus to blend these
ingredients until the dish is full; be sure, though, that the
crumbs cover the eggs upon top. Over the whole pour a large
teacupful of sweet cream or milk and brown nicely in a moderately
heated oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SHIRRED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Set into the oven until quite hot a common white dish large
enough to hold the number of eggs to be cooked, allowing plenty of
room for each. Melt in it a small piece of butter, and breaking the
eggs carefully in a saucer, one at a time, slip them into the hot
dish; sprinkle over them a small quantity of pepper and salt and
allow them to cook four or five minutes. Adding a tablespoonful of
cream for every two eggs, when the eggs are first slipped in, is a
great improvement.</p>
<p>This is far more delicate than fried eggs.</p>
<p>Or prepare the eggs the same and set them in a steamer over
boiling water.</p>
<p>They are usually served in hotels baked in individual dishes,
about two in a dish, and in the same dish they were baked in.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCRAMBLED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Put a tablespoonful of butter into a hot frying pan; tip around
so that it will touch all sides of the pan. Having ready half a
dozen eggs broken in a dish, salted and peppered, turn them
(without beating) into the hot butter; stir them one way briskly
for five or six minutes or until they are mixed. Be careful that
they do not get too hard. Turn over toast or dish up without.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POACHED OR DROPPED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Have one quart of <i>boiling</i> water and one tablespoonful of
salt in a frying pan. Break the eggs, one by one, into a saucer,
and slide carefully into the salted water. Dash with a spoon a
little water over the egg, to keep the top white.</p>
<p>The beauty of a poached egg is for the yolk to be seen blushing
through the white, which should only be just sufficiently hardened
to form a transparent veil for the egg.</p>
<p>Cook until the white is firm, and lift out with a griddle cake
turner and place on toasted bread. Serve immediately.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 228]</span><a name='Page_228' id=
"Page_228"></a>
<p>A tablespoonful of vinegar put into the water keeps the eggs
from spreading.</p>
<p>Open gem rings are nice placed in the water and an egg dropped
into each ring.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer, and then slide
them carefully off into a frying pan of lard and butter mixed,
dipping over the eggs the hot grease in spoonfuls, or turn them
over, frying both sides without breaking them. They require about
three minutes' cooking.</p>
<p>Eggs can be fried round like balls, by dropping one at a time
into a quantity of hot lard, the same as for fried cakes, first
stirring the hot lard with a stick until it runs round like a
whirlpool; this will make the eggs look like balls. Take out with a
skimmer. Eggs can be poached the same in boiling water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGGS AUX FINES HERBES.</b></p>
<p>Roll an ounce of butter in a good teaspoonful of flour; season
with pepper, salt and nutmeg; put it into a coffeecupful of fresh
milk, together with two teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley; stir and
simmer it for fifteen minutes, add a teacupful of thick cream.
Hard-boil five eggs and halve them; arrange them in a dish with the
ends upwards, pour the sauce over them, and decorate with little
heaps of fried bread crumbs round the margin of the dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POACHED EGGS &Aacute; LA CR&Ecirc;ME.</b></p>
<p>Put a quart of hot water, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a
teaspoonful of salt into a frying pan, and break each egg
separately into a saucer; slip the egg carefully into the hot
water, simmer three or four minutes until the white is set, then
with a skimmer lift them out into a hot dish. Empty the pan of its
contents, put in half a cup of cream, or rich milk; if milk, a
large spoonful of butter; pepper and salt to taste, thicken with a
very little cornstarch; let it boil up once, and turn it over the
dish of poached eggs. It can be served on toast or without.</p>
<p>It is a better plan to warm the cream in butter in a separate
dish, that the eggs may not have to stand.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 229]</span><a name='Page_229' id=
"Page_229"></a>
<p><b>EGGS IN CASES.</b></p>
<p>Make little paper cases of buttered writing paper; put a small
piece of butter in each, and a little chopped parsley or onion,
pepper and salt. Place the cases upon a gridiron over a moderate
fire of bright coals, and when the butter melts, break a fresh egg
into each case. Strew in upon them a few seasoned bread crumbs, and
when nearly done, glaze the tops with a hot shovel. Serve in the
paper cases.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MINCED EGGS.</b></p>
<p>Chop up four or five hard-boiled eggs; do not mince them too
fine. Put over the fire in a suitable dish a cupful of milk, a
tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper, and some savory chopped
small. When this comes to a boil stir into it a tablespoonful of
flour, dissolved in a little cold milk. When it cooks thick like
cream put in the minced eggs. Stir it gently around and around for
a few moments and serve, garnished with sippets of toast. Any
particular flavor may be given to this dish, such as that of
mushrooms, truffles, catsup, essence of shrimps, etc., or some
shred anchovy may be added to the mince.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MIXED EGGS AND BACON.</b></p>
<p>Take a nice rasher of mild bacon; cut it into squares no larger
than dice; fry it quickly until nicely browned; but on no account
burn it. Break half a dozen eggs into a basin, strain and season
them with pepper, add them to the bacon, stir the whole about and,
when sufficiently firm, turn it out into a dish. Decorate with hot
pickles.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MIXED EGGS GENERALLY&mdash;SAVORY OR SWEET.</b></p>
<p>Much the same method is followed in mixed eggs generally,
whatever may be added to them; really it is nothing more than an
omelet which is stirred about in the pan while it is being dressed,
instead of being allowed to set as a pancake. Chopped tongue,
oysters, shrimps, sardines, dried salmon, anchovies, herbs, may be
used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD EGGS FOR A PICNIC.</b></p>
<p>This novel way of preparing cold egg for the lunch-basket fully
repays one for the extra time required. Boil hard several eggs,
halve them lengthwise; remove the yolks and chop them fine with
cold chicken, lamb, veal or any tender, roasted meat; or with bread
soaked <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 230]</span><a name='Page_230' id=
"Page_230"></a>in milk and any salad, as parsley, onion, celery,
the bread being half of the whole; or with grated cheese, a little
olive oil, drawn butter, flavored. Fill the cavity in the egg with
either of these mixtures, or any similar preparation. Press the
halves together, roll twice in beaten egg and bread crumbs, and dip
into boiling lard. When the color rises delicately, drain them and
they are ready for use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OMELETS.</b></p>
<p>In making an omelet, care should be taken that the omelet pan is
hot and dry. To insure this, put a small quantity of lard or suet
into a clean frying pan, let it simmer a few minutes, then remove
it; wipe the pan dry with a towel, and then put in a tablespoonful
of butter. The smoothness of the pan is most essential, as the
least particle of roughness will cause the omelet to stick. As a
general rule, a small omelet can be made more successfully than a
large one, it being much better to make two small ones of four eggs
each, than to try double the number of eggs in one omelet and fail.
Allow one egg to a person in making an omelet and one tablespoonful
of milk; this makes an omelet more puffy and tender than one made
without milk. Many prefer them without milk.</p>
<p>Omelets are called by the name of what is added to give them
flavor, as minced ham, salmon, onions, oysters, etc., beaten up in
the eggs in due quantity, which gives as many different kind of
omelets.</p>
<p>They are also served over many kinds of thick sauces or purees,
such as tomato, spinach, endive, lettuce, celery, etc.</p>
<p>If vegetables are to be added, they should be already cooked,
seasoned and hot; place in the centre of the omelet, just before
turning; so with mushroom, shrimps, or any cooked ingredients. All
omelets should be served the moment they are done, as they harden
by standing, and care taken that they do not <i>cook too
much</i>.</p>
<p>Sweet omelets are generally used for breakfast or plain
desserts.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Put a smooth, clean, iron frying pan on the fire to heat;
meanwhile, beat four eggs very light, the whites to a stiff froth
and the yolks to a thick batter. Add to the yolks four
tablespoonfuls of milk, pepper and salt; and, lastly, stir in the
whites lightly. Put a piece of butter nearly half the size of an
egg into the heated pan; turn it so that it will <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 231]</span><a name='Page_231' id=
"Page_231"></a>moisten the entire bottom, taking care that it does
not scorch. Just as it begins to boil, pour in the eggs. Hold the
frying pan handle in your left hand, and, as the eggs whiten,
carefully, with a spoon, draw up lightly from the bottom, letting
the raw part run out on the pan, till all be equally cooked; shake
with your left hand, till the omelet be free from the pan, then
turn with a spoon one half of the omelet over the other; let it
remain a moment, but continue shaking, lest it adhere; toss to a
warm platter held in the right hand, or lift with a flat, broad
shovel; the omelet will be firm around the edge, but creamy and
light inside.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MEAT OR FISH OMELETS.</b></p>
<p>Take cold meat, fish, game or poultry of any kind; remove all
skin, sinew, etc., and either cut it small or pound it to a paste
in a mortar, together with a proper proportion of spices and salt;
then either toss it in a buttered frying pan over a clear fire till
it begins to brown and pour beaten eggs upon it, or beat it up with
the eggs, or spread it upon them after they have begun to set in
the pan. In any case serve hot, with or without a sauce, but
garnish with crisp herbs in branches, pickles, or sliced lemon. The
right proportion is one tablespoonful of meat to four eggs. A
little milk, gravy, water, or white wine, may be advantageously
added to the eggs while they are being beaten.</p>
<p>Potted meats make admirable omelets in the above manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEGETABLE OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Make a pur&eacute;e by mashing up ready-dressed vegetables,
together with a little milk, cream or gravy and some seasoning. The
most suitable vegetables are cucumbers, artichokes, onions, sorrel,
green peas, tomatoes, lentils, mushrooms, asparagus tops, potatoes,
truffles or turnips. Prepare some eggs by beating them very light.
Pour them into a nice hot frying pan, containing a spoonful of
butter; spread the pur&eacute;e upon the upper side; and when
perfectly hot, turn or fold the omelet together and serve. Or cold
vegetables may be merely chopped small, then tossed in a little
butter, and some beaten and seasoned eggs poured over.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OMELET OF HERBS.</b></p>
<p>Parsley, thyme and sweet marjoram mixed gives the famous
<i>omelette aux fines herbes</i> so popular at every wayside inn in
the most remote corner of sunny France. An omelet "jardiniere" is
two table<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 232]</span><a name='Page_232'
id="Page_232"></a>spoonfuls of mixed parsley, onion, chives,
shallots and a few leaves each of sorrel and chevril, minced fine
and stirred into the beaten eggs before cooking. It will take a
little more butter to fry it than a plain one.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHEESE OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Beat up three eggs, and add to them a tablespoonful of milk and
a tablespoonful of grated cheese; add a little more cheese before
folding; turn it out on a hot dish; grate a little cheese over it
before serving.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ASPARAGUS OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Boil with a little salt, and until about half cooked, eight or
ten stalks of asparagus, and cut the eatable part into rather small
pieces; beat the egg and mix the asparagus with them. Make the
omelet as above directed. Omelet with parsley is made by adding a
little chopped parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO OMELET. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Peel a couple of tomatoes, which split into four pieces; remove
the seeds and cut them into small dice; then fry them with a little
butter until nearly done, adding salt and pepper. Beat the eggs and
mix the tomatoes with them, and make the omelet as usual. Or stew a
few tomatoes in the usual way and spread over before folding.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO OMELET. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Cut in slices and place in a stewpan six peeled tomatoes; add a
tablespoonful of cold water, a little pepper and salt. When they
begin to simmer, break in six eggs, stir well, stirring one way,
until the eggs are cooked, but not too hard. Serve warm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RICE OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Take a cup of cold boiled rice, turn over it a cupful of warm
milk, add a tablespoonful of butter melted, a level teaspoonful of
salt, a dash of pepper; mix well, then add three well-beaten eggs.
Put a tablespoonful of butter in a hot frying pan, and when it
begins to boil pour in the omelet and set the pan in a hot oven. As
soon as it is cooked through, fold it double, turn it out on a hot
dish, and serve at once. Very good.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 233]</span><a name='Page_233' id=
"Page_233"></a>
<p><b>HAM OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Cut raw ham into dice, fry with butter and when cooked enough,
turn the beaten egg over it and cook as a plain omelet.</p>
<p>If boiled ham is used, mince it and mix with the egg after they
are beaten. Bacon may be used instead of raw ham.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Mince rather fine one cupful of cooked chicken, warm in a
teacupful of cream or rich milk a tablespoonful of butter, salt and
pepper; thicken with a large tablespoonful of flour. Make a plain
omelet, then add this mixture just before turning it over. This is
much better than the dry minced chicken. Tongue is equally
good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUSHROOM OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Clean a cupful of large button mushrooms, canned ones may be
used; cut them into bits. Put into a stewpan an ounce of butter and
let it melt; add the mushrooms, a teaspoonful of salt, half a
teaspoonful of pepper and half a cupful of cream or milk. Stir in a
teaspoonful of flour, dissolved in a little milk or water to
thicken, if needed. Boil ten minutes, and set aside until the
omelet is ready.</p>
<p>Make a plain omelet the usual way, and just before doubling it,
turn the mushrooms over the centre and serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Parboil a dozen oysters in their own liquor, skim them out and
let them cool; add them to the beaten eggs, either whole or minced.
Cook the same as a plain omelet.</p>
<p>Thicken the liquid with butter rolled in flour; season with
salt, cayenne pepper and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Chop up
the oysters and add to the sauce. Put a few spoonfuls in the centre
of the omelet before folding; when dished, pour the remainder of
the sauce around it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Make a plain omelet, and when ready to fold, spread over it fish
prepared as follows: Add to a cupful of any kind of cold fish,
broken fine, cream enough to moisten it, seasoned with a
tablespoonful of butter; then pepper and salt to taste. Warm
together.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 234]</span><a name='Page_234' id=
"Page_234"></a>
<p><b>ONION OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Make a plain omelet, and when ready to turn spread over it a
teaspoonful each of chopped onion and minced parsley; then fold,
or, if preferred, mix the minces into the eggs before cooking.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JELLY OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Make a plain omelet, and just before folding together, spread
with some kind of jelly. Turn out on a warm platter. Dust it with
powdered sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAD OMELET. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Break four eggs into a basin and carefully remove the treadles;
have ready a tablespoonful of grated and sifted bread; soak it in
either milk, water, cream, white wine, gravy, lemon juice, brandy
or rum, according as the omelet is intended to be sweet or savory.
Well beat the eggs together with a little nutmeg, pepper and salt;
add the bread, and, beating constantly (or the omelet will be
crumbly), get ready a frying pan, buttered and made thoroughly hot;
put in the omelet; do it on one side only; turn it upon a dish, and
fold it double to prevent the steam from condensing. Stale
sponge-cake, grated biscuit, or pound cake, may replace the bread
for a sweet omelet, when pounded loaf sugar should be sifted over
it, and the dish decorated with lumps of currant jelly. This makes
a nice dessert.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAD OMELET. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Let one teacupful of milk come to a boil, pour it over one
teacupful of bread crumbs and let it stand a few minutes. Break six
eggs into a bowl, stir (not beat) till well mixed; then add the
milk and bread, season with pepper and salt, mix all well together
and turn into a hot frying pan, containing a large spoonful of
butter boiling hot. Fry the omelet slowly, and when brown on the
bottom cut in squares and turn again, fry to a delicate brown and
serve hot.</p>
<p>Cracker omelet may be made by substituting three or four rolled
crackers in place of bread.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Beat the whites and yolks of four or six eggs separately; add to
the yolks a small cup of milk, a tablespoonful of flour or
cornstarch, a teaspoonful of baking powder, one-half teaspoonful of
salt, and, lastly, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 235]</span><a name=
'Page_235' id="Page_235"></a>the stiff-beaten whites. Bake in a
well-buttered pie-tin or plate about half an hour in a steady oven.
It should be served the moment it is taken from the oven, as it is
liable to fall.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OMELET SOUFFL&Eacute;.</b></p>
<p>Break six eggs into separate cups; beat four of the yolks, mix
with them one teaspoonful of flour, three tablespoonfuls of
powdered sugar, very little salt. Flavor with extract lemon or any
other of the flavors that may be preferred. Whisk the whites of six
eggs to a firm froth; mix them lightly with the yolks; pour the
mixture into a greased pan or dish; bake in a quick oven. When
well-risen and lightly browned on the top, it is done; roll out in
warm dish, sift pulverized sugar over, and send to table.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RUM OMELET.</b></p>
<p>Put a small quantity of lard into the pan; let it simmer a few
minutes and remove it; wipe the pan dry with a towel, and put in a
little fresh lard in which the omelet may be fried. Care should be
taken that the lard does not burn, which would spoil the color of
the omelet. Break three eggs separately; put them into a bowl and
whisk them thoroughly with a fork. The longer they are beaten, the
lighter will the omelet be. Beat up a teaspoonful of milk with the
eggs and continue to beat until the last moment before pouring into
the pan, which should be over a hot fire. As soon as the omelet
sets, remove the pan from the hottest part of the fire. Slip a
knife under it to prevent sticking to the pan. When the centre is
almost firm, slant the pan, work the omelet in shape to fold easily
find neatly, and when slightly browned, hold a platter against the
edge of the pan and deftly turn it out on to the hot dish. Dust a
liberal quantity of powdered sugar over it, and singe the sugar
into neat stripes with a hot iron rod, heated in the coals; pour a
glass of warm Jamaica rum around it, and when it is placed on the
table set fire to the rum. With a tablespoon dash the burning rum
over the omelet, put out the fire and serve. Salt <i>mixed</i> with
the eggs prevents them from rising, and when it is so used the
omelet will look flabby, yet without salt it will taste
insipid.</p>
<p>Add a little salt to it just before folding it and turning out
on the dish.</p>

<h2><b>SANDWICHES.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>HAM SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>Make a dressing of half a cup of butter, one tablespoonful of
mixed mustard, one of salad oil, a little red or white pepper, a
pinch of salt and the yolk of an egg; rub the butter to a cream,
add the other ingredients and mix thoroughly; then stir in as much
chopped ham as will make it consistent and spread between thin
slices of bread. Omit salad oil and substitute melted butter if
preferred.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HAM SANDWICHES, PLAIN.</b></p>
<p>Trim the crusts from thin slices of bread; butter them and lay
between every two some thin slices of cold boiled ham. Spread the
meat with a little mustard if liked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>Mince up fine any cold boiled or roasted chicken; put it into a
saucepan with gravy, water or cream enough to soften it; add a good
piece of butter, a pinch of pepper; work it very smooth while it is
heating until it looks almost like a paste. Then spread it on a
plate to cool. Spread it between slices of buttered bread.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SARDINE SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>Take two boxes of sardines and throw the contents into hot
water, having first drained away all the oil. A few minutes will
free the sardines from grease. Pour away the water and dry the fish
in a cloth; then scrape away the skins and pound the sardines in a
mortar till reduced to paste; add pepper, salt and some tiny pieces
of lettuce, and spread on the sandwiches, which have been
previously cut as above. The lettuce adds very much to the flavor
of the sardines.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 237]</span><a name='Page_237' id=
"Page_237"></a>
<p>Or chop the sardines up fine and squeeze a few drops of lemon
juice into them, and spread between buttered bread or cold
biscuits.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WATER CRESS SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>Wash well some water cress and then dry them in a cloth,
pressing out every atom of moisture as far as possible; then mix
with the cress hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and seasoned with
salt and pepper. Have a stale loaf and some fresh butter, and with
a sharp knife cut as many thin slices as will be required for two
dozen sandwiches; then cut the cress into small pieces, removing
the stems; place it between each slice of bread and butter, with a
slight sprinkling of lemon juice; press down the slices hard, and
cut them sharply on a board into small squares, leaving no
crust.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Nantasket Beach.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>EGG SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>Hard boil some very fresh eggs and when cold cut them into
moderately thin slices and lay them between some bread and butter
cut as thin as possible; season them with pepper, salt and nutmeg.
For picnic parties, or when one is traveling, these sandwiches are
far preferable to hard-boiled eggs <i>au naturel</i>.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUSHROOM SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>Mince beef tongue and boiled mushrooms together, add French
mustard and spread between buttered bread.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHEESE SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>These are extremely nice and are very easily made. Take one
hard-boiled egg, a quarter of a pound of common cheese grated, half
a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, half a
teaspoonful of mustard, one tablespoonful of melted butter, and one
tablespoonful of vinegar or cold water. Take the yolk of the egg
and put it into a small bowl and crumble it down, put into it the
butter and mix it smooth with a spoon, then add the salt, pepper,
mustard and the cheese, mixing each well. Then put in the
tablespoonful of vinegar, which will make it the proper thickness.
If vinegar is not relished, then use cold water instead. Spread
this between two biscuits or pieces of oat-cake, and you could not
require a better sandwich. Some people will prefer the sandwiches
less highly seasoned. In that case, season to taste.</p>

<a name='BREAD' id="BREAD"></a>
<h2><b>BREAD.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Among all civilized people bread has become an article of food
of the first necessity; and properly so, for it constitutes of
itself a complete life sustainer, the gluten, starch and sugar
which it contains representing ozotized and hydro-carbonated
nutrients, and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms in one product. As there is no one article of
food that enters so largely into our daily fare as bread, so no
degree of skill in preparing other articles can compensate for lack
of knowledge in the art of making good, palatable and nutritious
bread. A little earnest attention to the subject will enable any
one to comprehend the theory, and then ordinary care in practice
will make one familiar with the process.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</b></p>
<p>The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the
utmost cleanliness; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all
the ingredients used for it; and, in addition to these, there must
be attention and care through the whole process.</p>
<p>Salt is always used in bread-making, not only on account of its
flavor, which destroys the insipid raw state of the flour, but
because it makes the dough rise better.</p>
<p>In mixing with milk, the milk should be boiled&mdash;not simply
scalded, but heated to boiling over hot water&mdash;then set aside
to cool before mixing. Simple heating will not prevent bread from
turning sour in the rising, while boiling will act as a
preventative. So the milk should be thoroughly scalded, and should
be used when it is just blood warm.</p>
<p>Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient time allowed
for the dough to rise, will cause the bread to be heavy.</p>
<p>The yeast must be good and fresh if the bread is to be
digestible and nice. Stale yeast produces, instead of vinous
fermentation, an <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 239]</span><a name=
'Page_239' id="Page_239"></a>acetous fermentation, which flavors
the bread and makes it disagreeable. A poor, thin yeast produces an
imperfect fermentation, the result being a heavy, unwholesome
loaf.</p>
<p>If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork
itself&mdash;that is to say, if the mixing and kneading be
neglected when it has reached the proper point for
either&mdash;sour bread will probably be the consequence in warm
weather, and bad bread in any. The goodness will also be endangered
by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of it hot, instead
of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of heat required for its
due fermentation.</p>
<p>Heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the
dough very hard and letting it become quite cold, particularly in
winter.</p>
<p>An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half
made, and to allow it to become cold before it is finished. The
other most common causes of failure are using yeast which is no
longer sweet, or which has been frozen, or has had hot liquid
poured over it.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather
quick and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without
hardening the outside. The oven door should not be opened after the
bread is put in until the dough is set or has become firm, as the
cool air admitted will have an unfavorable effect upon it.</p>
<p>The dough should rise and the bread begin to brown after about
fifteen minutes, but only slightly. Bake from fifty to sixty
minutes and have it brown, not black or whitey brown, but brown all
over when well baked.</p>
<p>When the bread is baked, remove the loaves immediately from the
pans and place them where the air will circulate freely around
them, and thus carry off the gas which has been formed, but is no
longer needed.</p>
<p>Never leave the bread in the pan or on a pin table to absorb the
odor of the wood. If you like crusts that are crisp do not cover
the loaves; but to give the soft, tender, wafer-like consistency
which many prefer, wrap them while still hot in several thicknesses
of bread-cloth. When cold put them in a stone jar, removing the
cloth, as that absorbs the moisture and gives the bread an
unpleasant taste and odor. Keep the jar well covered and carefully
cleansed from crumbs and stale pieces. Scald and dry it thoroughly
every two or three days. A yard <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
240]</span><a name='Page_240' id="Page_240"></a>and a half square
of coarse table linen makes the best bread-cloth. Keep in good
supply; use them for no other purpose.</p>
<p>Some people use scalding water in making wheat bread; in that
case the flour must be scalded and allowed to cool before the yeast
is added&mdash;then proceed as above. Bread made in this manner
keeps moist in summer much longer than when made in the usual
mode.</p>
<p>Home-made yeast is generally preferred to any other. Compressed
yeast, as now sold in most grocery stores, makes fine light, sweet
bread, and is a much quicker process, and can always be had fresh,
being made fresh every day.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHEAT BREAD.</b></p>
<p>Sift the flour into a large bread-pan or bowl; make a hole in
the middle of it, and pour in the yeast in the ratio of half a
teacupful of yeast to two quarts of flour; stir the yeast lightly,
then pour in your "wetting," either milk or water, as you
choose,&mdash;which use warm in winter and cold in summer; if you
use water as "wetting," dissolve in it a bit of butter of the size
of an egg,&mdash;if you use milk, no butter is necessary; stir in
the "wetting" very lightly, but do not mix all the flour into it;
then cover the pan with a thick blanket or towel, and set it, in
winter, in a warm place to rise,&mdash;this is called "<i>putting
the bread in sponge</i>." In summer the bread should not be wet
over night. In the morning add a teaspoonful of salt and mix all
the flour in the pan with the sponge, kneading it well; then let it
stand two hours or more until it has risen quite light; then remove
the dough to the molding-board and mold it for a long time, cutting
it in pieces and molding them together again and again, until the
dough is elastic under the pressure of your hand, using as little
flour as possible; then make it into loaves, put the loaves into
baking-tins. The loaves should come half way up the pan, and they
should be allowed to rise until the bulk is doubled. When the
loaves are ready to put into the oven, the oven should be ready to
receive them. It should be hot enough to brown a teaspoonful of
flour in five minutes. The heat should be greater at the bottom
than at the top of the oven, and the fire so arranged as to give
sufficient strength of heat through the baking without being
replenished. Let them stand ten or fifteen minutes, prick them
three or four times with a fork, bake in a quick oven from
forty-five to sixty minutes.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 241]</span><a name='Page_241' id=
"Page_241"></a>
<p>If these directions are followed, you will obtain sweet, tender
and wholesome bread. If by any mistake the dough becomes sour
before you are ready to bake it, you can rectify it by adding a
little dry super-carbonate of soda, molding the dough a long time
to distribute the soda equally throughout the mass. All bread is
better, if naturally sweet, without the soda; but <i>sour bread</i>
you should never eat, if you desire good health.</p>
<p>Keep well covered in a tin box or large stone crock, which
should be wiped out every day or two, and scalded and dried
thoroughly in the sun once a week.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COMPRESSED YEAST BREAD.</b></p>
<p>Use for two loaves of bread three quarts of sifted flour, nearly
a quart of warm water, a level tablespoonful of salt and an ounce
of compressed yeast. Dissolve the yeast in a pint of lukewarm
water; then stir into it enough flour to make a thick batter. Cover
the bowl containing the batter or sponge with a thick folded cloth
and set it in a warm place to rise; if the temperature of heat is
properly attended to the sponge will be foamy and light in half an
hour. Now stir into this sponge the salt dissolved in a little warm
water, add the rest of the flour and sufficient warm water to make
the dough stiff enough to knead; then knead it from five to ten
minutes, divide it into loaves, knead again each loaf and put them
into buttered baking tins; cover them with a double thick cloth and
set again in a warm place to rise twice their height, then bake the
same as any bread. This bread has the advantage of that made of
home-made yeast as it is made inside of three hours, whereas the
other requires from twelve to fourteen hours.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOME-MADE YEAST.</b></p>
<p>Boil six large potatoes in three pints of water. Tie a handful
of hops in a small muslin bag and boil with the potatoes; when
thoroughly cooked drain the water on enough flour to make a thin
batter; set this on the stove or range and scald it enough to cook
the flour (this makes the yeast keep longer); remove it from the
fire and when cool enough, add the potatoes mashed, also half a cup
of sugar, half a tablespoonful of ginger, two of salt and a
teacupful of yeast. Let it stand in a warm place, until it has
thoroughly risen, then put it in <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
242]</span><a name='Page_242' id="Page_242"></a>a large mouthed jug
and cork tightly; set away in a cool place. The jug should be
scalded before putting in the yeast.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of a coffeecupful of this yeast will make four
loaves.</p>
<br>
<p><b>UNRIVALED YEAST.</b></p>
<p>On one morning boil two ounces of the best hops in four quarts
of water half an hour; strain it, and let the liquor cool to the
consistency of new milk; then put it in an earthen bowl and add
half a cupful of salt and half a cupful of brown sugar; beat up one
quart of flour with some of the liquor; then mix all well together,
and let it stand till the third day after; then add six
medium-sized potatoes, boiled and mashed through a colander; let it
stand a day, then strain and bottle and it is fit for use. It must
be stirred frequently while it is making, and kept near a fire. One
advantage of this yeast is its spontaneous fermentation, requiring
the help of no old yeast; if care be taken to let it ferment well
in the bowl, it may immediately be corked tightly. Be careful to
keep it in a cool place. Before using it shake the bottle up well.
It will keep in a cool place two months, and is best the latter
part of the time. Use about the same quantity as of other
yeast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRIED YEAST OR YEAST CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Make a pan of yeast the same as "Home-Made Yeast;" mix in with
it corn meal that has been sifted and dried, kneading it well until
it is thick enough to roll out, when it can be cut into cakes or
crumble up. Spread out and dry thoroughly in the shade; keep in a
dry place.</p>
<p>When it is convenient to get compressed yeast, it is much better
and cheaper than to make your own, a saving of time and trouble.
Almost all groceries keep it, delivered to them fresh made
daily.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALT-RAISING BREAD.</b></p>
<p>While getting breakfast in the morning, as soon as the
tea-kettle has boiled, take a quart tin cup or an earthen quart
milk pitcher, scald it, then fill one-third full of water about as
warm as the finger could be held in; then to this add a teaspoonful
of salt, a pinch of brown sugar and coarse flour enough to make a
batter of about the right consistency for griddle-cakes. Set the
cup, with the spoon in it, in a closed vessel half-filled with
water moderately hot, but not scalding. Keep the tem<span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 243]</span><a name='Page_243' id=
"Page_243"></a>perature as nearly even as possible and add a
teaspoonful of flour once or twice during the process of
fermentation. The yeast ought to reach to the top of the bowl in
about five hours. Sift your flour into a pan, make an opening in
the centre and pour in your yeast. Have ready a pitcher of warm
milk, salted, or milk and water (not too hot, or you will scald the
yeast germs), and stir rapidly into a pulpy mass with a spoon.
Cover this sponge closely and keep warm for an hour, then knead
into loaves, adding flour to make the proper consistency. Place in
warm, well-greased pans, cover closely and leave till it is light.
Bake in a steady oven, and when done let all the hot steam escape.
Wrap closely in damp towels and keep in closed earthen jars until
it is wanted.</p>
<p>This, in our grandmothers' time, used to be considered the prize
bread, on account of its being sweet and wholesome and required no
prepared yeast to make it. Nowadays yeast-bread is made with very
little trouble, as the yeast can be procured at almost any
grocery.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAD FROM MILK YEAST.</b></p>
<p>At noon the day before baking, take half a cup of corn meal and
pour over it enough sweet milk boiling hot to make it the thickness
of batter-cakes. In the winter place it where it will keep warm.
The next morning before breakfast pour into a pitcher a pint of
boiling water; add one teaspoonful of soda and one of salt. When
cool enough so that it will not scald the flour, add enough to make
a stiff batter; then add the cup of meal set the day before. This
will be full of little bubbles. Then place the pitcher in a kettle
of warm water, cover the top with a folded towel and put it where
it will keep warm, and you will be surprised to find how soon the
yeast will be at the top of the pitcher. Then pour the yeast into a
bread-pan; add a pint and a half of warm water, or half water and
half milk, and flour enough to knead into loaves. Knead but little
harder than for biscuit and bake as soon as it rises to the top of
the tin. This recipe makes five large loaves. Do not allow it to
get too light before baking, for it will make the bread dry and
crumbling. A cup of this milk yeast is excellent to raise buckwheat
cakes.</p>

<p><b>GRAHAM BREAD.</b></p>
<p>One teacupful of wheat flour, one-half teacupful of Porto Rico
molasses, one-half cupful of good yeast, one teaspoonful of salt,
one <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 244]</span><a name='Page_244' id=

make the dough as stiff as can be stirred with a strong spoon; this
is to be mixed at night; in the morning, add one teaspoonful of
soda, dissolved in a little water; mix well, and pour into two
medium-sized pans; they will be about half full; let it stand in a
warm place until it rises to the top of the pans, then bake one
hour in a pretty hot oven.</p>
<p>This should be covered about twenty minutes when first put into
the oven with a thick brown paper, or an old tin cover; it prevents
the upper crust hardening before the loaf is well-risen. If these
directions are correctly followed the bread will not be heavy or
sodden, as it has been tried for years and never failed.</p>

<p><b>INDIAN LOAF CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Mix a teacupful of powdered white sugar with a quart of rich
milk, and cut up in the milk two ounces of butter, adding a
saltspoonful of salt. Put this mixture into a covered pan or
skillet, and set it on the fire till it is scalding hot. Then take
it off, and scald with it as much yellow Indian meal (previously
sifted) as will make it of the consistency of thick boiled mush.
Beat the whole very hard for a quarter of an hour, and then set it
away to cool.</p>
<p>While it is cooling, beat three eggs very light, and stir them
gradually into the mixture when it is about as warm as new milk.
Add a teacupful of good strong yeast and beat the whole another
quarter of an hour, for much of the goodness of this cake depends
on its being long and well beaten. Then have ready a tin mold or
earthen pan with a pipe in the centre (to diffuse the heat through
the middle of the cake). The pan must be very well-buttered as
Indian meal is apt to stick. Put in the mixture, cover it and set
it in a warm place to rise. It should be light in about four hours.
Then bake it two hours in a moderate oven. When done, turn it out
with the broad surface downwards and send it to table hot and
whole. Cut it into slices and eat it with butter.</p>
<p>This will be found an excellent cake. If wanted for breakfast,
mix it and set it to rise the night before. If properly made,
standing all night will not injure it. Like all Indian cakes (of
which this is one of the best), it should be eaten warm.</p>

enough to make a batter as for griddle-cakes; to this allow half a
teacupful of fresh yeast; let it rise till it is light and bubbles
of air form; then dissolve half a teaspoonful of soda in a spoonful
of warm water and add to the batter; bake in muffin tins. These are
good also with fricasseed chicken; take them from the tins and drop
in the gravy just before sending to the table.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;'>
<br>
<h2>BISCUITS, ROLLS, MUFFINS, ETC.</h2>
<p><b>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS.</b></p>
<br>
<p>In making batter-cakes, the ingredients should be put together
over night to rise, and the eggs and butter added in the morning;
the butter melted and eggs well beaten. If the batter appears sour
in the least, dissolve a little soda and stir into it; this should
be done early enough to rise some time before baking.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 250]</span><a name='Page_250' id=
"Page_250"></a>
<p>Water can be used in place of milk in all raised dough, and the
dough should be thoroughly light before making into loaves or
biscuits; then when molding them use as little flour as possible;
the kneading to be done when first made from the sponge, and should
be done well and for some length of time, as this makes the pores
fine, the bread cut smooth and tender. Care should be taken not to
get the dough too stiff.</p>
<p>Where any recipe calls for baking powder, and you do not have
it, you can use cream of tartar and soda, in the proportion of one
level teaspoonful of soda to two of cream of tartar.</p>
<p>When the recipe calls for sweet milk or cream, and you do not
have it, you may use in place of it sour milk or cream, and, in
that case, baking powder or cream of tartar <i>must not</i> be
used, but baking-soda, using a <i>level</i> teaspoonful to a quart
of sour milk; the milk is always best when just turned, so that it
is solid, and not sour enough to whey or to be watery.</p>
<p>When making biscuits or bread with baking powder or soda and
cream of tartar, the oven should be prepared first; the dough
handled quickly and put into the oven immediately, as soon as it
becomes the proper lightness, to ensure good success. If the oven
is <i>too slow</i>, the article baked will be heavy and hard.</p>
<p>As in beating cake, never <i>stir</i> ingredients into batter,
but beat them in, by beating down from the bottom, and up, and over
again. This laps the air into the batter which produces little
air-cells and causes the dough to puff and swell as it comes in
contact with the heat while cooking.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO RENEW STALE ROLLS.</b></p>
<p>To freshen stale biscuits or rolls, put them into a steamer for
ten minutes, then dry them off in a hot oven; or dip each roll for
an instant in cold water and heat them crisp in the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WARM BREAD FOR BREAKFAST..</b></p>
<p>Dough after it has become once sufficiently raised and perfectly
light, cannot afterwards be injured by setting aside in any cold
place where it cannot <i>freeze</i>; therefore, biscuits, rolls,
etc., can be made late the day before wanted for breakfast. Prepare
them ready for baking by molding them out late in the evening; lay
them a little apart on buttered tins; cover the tins with a cloth,
then fold around that a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
251]</span><a name='Page_251' id="Page_251"></a>newspaper, so as to
exclude the air, as that has a tendency to cause the crust to be
hard and thick when baked. The best place in summer is to place
them in the ice-box, then all you have to do in the morning (an
hour before breakfast time, and while the oven is heating) is to
bring them from the ice-box, take off the cloth and warm it, and
place it over them again; then set the tins in a warm place near
the fire. This will give them time to rise and bake when needed. If
these directions are followed rightly, you will find it makes no
difference with their lightness and goodness, and you can always be
sure of warm raised biscuits for breakfast in one hour's time.</p>
<p>Stale rolls may be made light and flakey by dipping for a moment
in cold water, and placing immediately in a very hot oven to be
made crisp and hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SODA BISCUIT.</b></p>
<p>One quart of sifted flour, one teaspoonful of soda, two
teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful of salt; mix
thoroughly, and rub in two tablespoonfuls of butter and wet with
one pint of sweet milk. Bake in a quick oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKING POWDER BISCUIT.</b></p>
<p>Two pints of flour, butter the size of an egg, three heaping
teaspoonfuls of baking powder and one teaspoonful of salt; make a
soft dough of sweet milk or water, knead as little as possible, cut
out with the usual biscuit-cutter and bake in rather a quick
oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOUR MILK BISCUIT.</b></p>
<p>Rub into a quart of sifted flour a piece of butter the size of
an egg, one teaspoonful of salt; stir into this a pint of sour
milk, dissolve one teaspoonful of soda and stir into the milk just
as you add it to the flour; knead it up quickly, roll it out nearly
half an inch thick and cut out with a biscuit-cutter; bake
immediately in a quick oven.</p>
<p>Very nice biscuit may be made with sour cream without the butter
by the same process.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RAISED BISCUIT.</b></p>
<p>Sift two quarts of flour in a mixing-pan, make a hole in the

stir in a little flour, then add half a cupful of yeast, after
which stir in as much flour <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
252]</span><a name='Page_252' id="Page_252"></a>as you can
conveniently with your hand, let it rise over night; in the morning
add nearly a teaspoonful of soda, and more flour as is needed to
make a rather soft dough; then mold fifteen to twenty minutes, the
longer the better; let it rise until light again, roll this out
about half an inch thick and cut out with a biscuit-cutter, or make
it into little balls with your hands; cover and set in a warm place
to rise. When light, bake a light brown in a moderate oven. Rub a
little warm butter or sweet lard on the sides of the biscuits when
you place them on the tins, to prevent their sticking together when
baked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LIGHT BISCUIT. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Take a piece of bread dough that will make about as many
biscuits as you wish; lay it out rather flat in a bowl; break into
it two eggs, half a cup of sugar, half a cup of butter; mix this
thoroughly with enough flour to keep it from sticking to the hands
and board. Knead it well for about fifteen or twenty minutes, make
into small biscuits, place in a greased pan, and let them rise
until about even with the top of the pan. Bake in a quick oven for
about half an hour.</p>
<p>These can be made in the form of rolls, which some prefer.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LIGHT BISCUIT. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>When you bake take a pint of sponge, one tablespoonful of melted

<p>Melt the butter in the warm milk, then add the sugar, salt and
flour, and let it rise over night. Mix rather soft. In the morning,
add to this half of a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a spoonful
of water. Mix in enough flour to make the same stiffness as any
biscuit dough; roll out not more than a quarter of an inch thick.
Cut with a large round cutter; spread soft butter over the tops and
fold one-half over the other by doubling it. Place them apart a
little so that there will be room to rise. Cover and place them
near the fire for fifteen or twenty minutes before baking. Bake in
rather a quick oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. (Unfermented.)</b></p>

teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a tablespoonful of cold butter, a
teaspoonful of salt and one of sugar, and a well-beaten egg; rub
all well into the flour, pour in a pint of cold milk, mix up
quickly into a smooth dough, roll it out less than half an inch
thick, cut with a large biscuit-cutter, spread soft butter over the
top of each; fold one-half over the other by doubling it, lay them
a little apart on greased tins. Set them immediately in a pretty

oven, to give them a glaze.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH ROLLS.</b></p>
<p>Three cups of sweet milk, one cup of butter and lard, mixed in

well until the dough blisters and cracks; pull off a two-inch
square of the dough; roll it into a ball with the hand; flatten,
stick with a fork, and bake in a quick oven.</p>
<p>It is not beating hard that makes the biscuit nice, but the
regularity of the motion. Beating hard, the old cooks say,

<p><b>SALLY LUNN.</b></p>
<p>Warm one-half cupful of butter in a pint of milk; add a
teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of sugar, and seven cupfuls of
<i>sifted</i> flour; beat thoroughly and when the mixture is blood
warm, add four beaten eggs and last of all, half a cup of good
lively yeast. Beat hard until the batter breaks in blisters. Set it
to rise over night. In the morning, dissolve half a teaspoonful of
soda, stir it into the batter and turn it into a well-buttered,
shallow dish to rise again about fifteen or twenty minutes. Bake
about fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>
<p>The cake should be torn apart, not cut; cutting with a knife
makes warm bread heavy. Bake a light brown. This cake is frequently
seen on Southern tables.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALLY LUNN. (Unfermented.)</b></p>
<p>Rub a piece of butter as large as an egg into a quart of flour;
add a tumbler of milk, two eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar,
three tablespoonfuls of baking powder and a teaspoonful of salt.

thick batter; set this as a sponge over night. In the morning add
half a cup of melted butter, one cup of sugar, half a nutmeg
grated, one saltspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of soda, and
flour enough to roll out like biscuit. Knead well and set to rise
for five hours. Roll the dough half an inch thick; cut in round
cakes and lay in rows in a buttered baking-pan, and let the cakes
stand half an hour, or until light; then put them in the oven,
having first made a deep cross on each with a knife. Bake a light
brown and brush over with white of egg beaten stiff with powdered

<p>In one large coffeecup of warm milk dissolve half a cake of
compressed yeast, or three tablespoonfuls of home-made yeast; to
this add three well-beaten eggs, a small cup of sugar and a
teaspoonful of salt; beat these together. Use flour enough to make
a smooth, light dough, let it stand until very light, then knead it
in the form of biscuits; place them on buttered tins and let them
rise until they are almost up to the edge of the tins; pierce the
top of each one and bake in a quick oven. Glaze the top of each
with sugar and milk, or the white of an egg, before baking. Some
add dried currants, well-washed and dried in the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RUSKS.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of raised dough, one of sugar, half a cup of butter,
two well-beaten eggs, flour enough to make a stiff dough; set to

and then sprinkle dry sugar over them. Bake immediately.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCOTCH SCONES.</b></p>
<p>Thoroughly mix, while dry, one quart of sifted flour, loosely
measured, with two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder; then rub
into it a tablespoonful of cold butter and a teaspoonful of salt.
Be sure that the butter is well worked in. Add sweet milk enough to
make a <i>very</i> soft paste. Roll out the paste about a quarter
of an inch thick, using plenty of flour on the paste-board and
rolling pin. Cut it into triangular pieces, each side about four
inches long. Flour the sides and bottom of a biscuit tin, and place
the pieces on it. Bake immediately in a quick oven from twenty to
thirty minutes. When half done, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg

and cut them a round shape the size of a saucer, then scarred
across to form four quarters.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRACKNELS.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of rich milk, four tablespoonfuls of butter and a gill
of yeast, a teaspoonful of salt; mix warm, add flour enough to make
a light dough. When light, roll thin and cut in long pieces three
inches wide, prick well with a fork and bake in a slow oven. They
are to be mixed rather hard and rolled very thin, like soda
crackers.</p>

Sift together flour, sugar, salt and baking powder; rub in the lard
cold, add the beaten eggs and milk; mix quickly into a smooth
batter, a little firmer than for griddle-cakes. Grease well some
muffin-pans and fill them two-thirds full. Bake in a hot oven
fifteen or twenty minutes. These made of cream, omitting the
butter, are excellent.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN MUFFINS.</b></p>
<p>One egg well beaten, a tablespoonful of butter and a
tablespoonful of sugar, with a teaspoonful of salt, all beaten
until very light. One cup of milk, three of sifted flour and three
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. One-half Graham and one-half rye
meal may be used instead of wheat flour, or two cups of corn meal
and one of flour.</p>
<p>Drop on well-greased patty-pans and bake twenty minutes in a

<p><b>GRAHAM GEMS. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of Graham flour, one cupful of wheat flour, two
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a tablespoonful of sugar, one of
salt and one well-beaten egg.</p>
<p>Mix with sweet milk to make a thin batter; beat it well. Bake in
gem-irons; have the irons well greased; fill two-thirds full and

<p><b>GRAHAM GEMS. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Three cups of sour milk, one teaspoonful of soda, one of salt,
one tablespoonful of brown sugar, one of melted lard or butter, one
or two beaten eggs; to the egg add the milk, then the sugar and
salt, then the Graham flour (with the soda mixed in), together with
the lard or butter; make a stiff batter, so that it will
<i>drop</i>, not pour, from the spoon. Have the gem-pans very hot,
fill and bake fifteen minutes in a hot oven.</p>
<p>The same can be made of sweet milk, using three teaspoonfuls of
baking powder instead of soda, and if you use sweet milk, put in no
shortening. Excellent.</p>
<p>Muffins of all kinds should only be cut just around the edge,
then pulled open with the fingers.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN GRAHAM GEMS.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of the best Graham meal, two of water, fresh and
cold, or milk and water, and a little salt. Stir briskly for a
minute or two. Have the gem-pan, hot and well greased, on the top
of the stove while pouring in the batter. Then place in a very hot
oven and bake forty minutes. It is best to check the heat a little
when they are nearly done. As the best prepared gems may be spoiled
if the heat is not sufficient, care and judgment must be used in
order to secure this most healthful as well, as delicious

<p><b>NEWPORT WAFFLES.</b></p>
<p>Make one pint of Indian meal into mush in the usual way. While
hot, put in a small lump of butter and a dessertspoonful of salt.
Set the mush aside to cool. Meanwhile, beat separately till very
light the whites and yolks of four eggs. Add the eggs to the mush,
and cream in gradually one quart of wheaten flour. Add half a pint
of buttermilk, or sour cream, in which has been dissolved half a
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Lastly, bring to the consistency
of thin batter by the addition of sweet milk. Waffle-irons should
be put on to heat an hour in advance, that they may be in the
proper condition for baking as soon as the batter is ready. Have a
brisk fire, butter the irons thoroughly, but with nicety, and bake
quickly. Fill the irons only half full of batter, that the waffles
may have room to rise.</p>

home-made yeast and sufficient flour to make a stiff batter; set it
in a warm place to rise; let it stand three hours or over night;
before baking add the beaten whites; bake like any other
griddle-cakes. Be sure to make the batter stiff enough, for flour
must not be added after it has risen, unless it is allowed to rise
again. These, half corn meal and half wheat, are very nice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FEATHER GRIDDLE-CAKES. (With Yeast.)</b></p>
<p>Make a batter, at night, of a pint of water or milk, a
teaspoonful of salt, and half a teacupful of yeast; in the morning,
add to it one teacupful of thick, sour milk, two eggs well beaten,
a level tablespoonful of melted butter, a level teaspoonful of soda

<br>
<p><b>WHEAT GRIDDLE-CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Three cups of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls

and three tablespoonfuls of home-made yeast. Mix this over night.
In the morning add one tablespoonful of melted butter or lard, two
beaten eggs and a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little
water.</p>
<p>This batter should stand a few minutes, after adding the butter
and soda, that it should have time to rise a little; in the
meantime the griddle could be heating. Take a small stick like a
good-sized skewer, wind a bit of cloth around the end of it, fasten
it by winding a piece of thread around that and tying it firm. Melt
together a tablespoonful of butter and lard. Grease the griddle
with this. Between each batch of cakes, wipe the griddle off with a
clean paper or cloth and grease afresh. Put the cakes on by
spoonfuls, or pour them carefully from a pitcher, trying to get
them as near the same size as possible. As soon as they begin to
bubble all over turn them, and cook on the other side till they
stop puffing. The second lot always cooks better than the first, as
the griddle becomes evenly heated.</p>

bread into the boiling milk, and let stand for ten minutes in a
covered bowl, then beat to a smooth paste; add the yolks of the
eggs well whipped, the butter, salt, soda, and finally the whites
of the eggs previously whipped stiff, and add half of a cupful of

brown, and serve with maple syrup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO GRIDDLE-CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Twelve large potatoes, three heaping tablespoonfuls of flour,
one teaspoonful of baking powder, one-half teaspoonful salt, one or
two eggs, two teacupfuls of boiling milk. The potatoes are peeled,
washed and grated into a little cold water (which keeps them
white), then strain off water and pour on boiling milk, stir in
eggs, salt and flour, mixed with the baking powder; if agreeable,
flavor with a little fine chopped onion; bake like any other
pancakes, allowing a little more lard or butter. Serve with stewed
or preserved fruit, especially with huckleberries.</p>

a time into a frying pan slightly greased, spreading the batter
evenly over the surface by tipping the pan about; fry to a light
brown; spread with jelly, roll up, dust with powdered sugar and
serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RAISED BUCKWHEAT CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Take a small crock or large earthen pitcher, put into it a quart
of warm water or half water and milk, one heaping teaspoonful of
salt; then stir in as much buckwheat flour as will thicken it to
rather a stiff batter; lastly, add half a cup of yeast; make it
smooth, cover it up warm to rise over night; in the morning add a
small, level teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little warm water;
this will remove any sour taste, if any, and increase the
lightness.</p>
<p>Not a few object to eating buckwheat, as its tendency is to
thicken the blood, and also to produce constipation; this can be
remedied by making the batter one-third corn meal and two-thirds
buckwheat, which makes the cakes equally as good. Many prefer them
in this way.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BUCKWHEAT CAKES WITHOUT YEAST.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of buckwheat flour, one of wheat flour, a little salt,

<br>
<p><b>CREAM FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>One cup of cream, five eggs&mdash;the whites only, two full cups

prepared flour, two cups of milk, one-half pound currants, washed
and well dried, five eggs whipped very light, one-half cup powdered
sugar, one tablespoonful butter, one-half teaspoonful mixed
cinnamon and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 267]</span><a name=
'Page_267' id="Page_267"></a>nutmeg. Boil the milk and pour over
the bread. Mix and put in the butter. Let it get cold. Beat in next
the yolks and sugar, the seasoning, flour and stiff whites;
finally, the currants dredged whitely with flour. The batter should
be thick. Drop in great spoonfuls into the hot lard and fry. Drain
them and send hot to table. Eat with a mixture of wine and powdered
sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHEAT FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Three eggs, one and a half cups of milk, three teaspoonfuls
baking powder, salt, and flour enough to make quite stiff, thicker
than batter cakes. Drop into hot lard and fry like doughnuts.</p>
<p><i>A Good Sauce for the Above.</i>&mdash;One cup of sugar, two
tablespoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of flour beaten together;
half a cup boiling water; flavor with extract lemon and boil until
clear. Or serve with maple syrup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Make a batter in the proportion of one cup sweet milk to two
cups flour, a heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, two eggs beaten
separately, one tablespoonful of sugar and a saltspoon of salt;
heat the milk a little more than milk-warm, add it slowly to the
beaten yolks and sugar; then add flour and whites of the eggs; stir
all together and throw in thin slices of good sour apples, dipping
the batter up over them; drop into boiling hot lard in large
spoonfuls with pieces of apple in each, and fry to a light brown.
Serve with maple syrup, or a nice syrup made with clarified
sugar.</p>
<p>Bananas, peaches, sliced oranges and other fruits can be used in
the same batter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PINEAPPLE FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Make a batter as for apple fritters; then pare one large
pineapple, cut it in slices a quarter of an inch thick, cut the
slices in halves, dip them into the batter and fry them, and serve
them as above.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Peel the peaches, split each in two and take out the stones;
dust a little powdered sugar over them; dip each piece in the
batter and fry in hot fat. A sauce to be served with them may be
made as follows: Put an ounce of butter in a saucepan and whisk it
to a cream; add four ounces of sugar gradually. Beat the yolks of
two eggs; add to them a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
268]</span><a name='Page_268' id="Page_268"></a>dash of nutmeg and
a gill each of cold water and rum; stir this into the luke-warm
batter and allow it to heat gradually. Stir constantly until of a
smooth, creamy consistency, and serve. The batter is made as
follows: Beat the yolks of three eggs; add to them a gill of milk,
or half of a cupful, a saltspoonful of salt, four ounces of flour;
mix. If old flour is used a little more milk may be found
necessary.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOLDEN-BALL FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Put into a stewpan a pint of water, a piece of butter as large
as an egg and a tablespoonful of sugar. When it boils stir into it
one pint of sifted flour, stirring briskly and thoroughly. Remove
from the fire, and when nearly cooled beat into it six eggs, each
one beaten separately and added one at a time, beating the batter
between each. Drop the stiff dough into boiling lard by
teaspoonfuls. Eat with syrup, or melted sugar and butter
flavored.</p>
<p>Stirring the boiling lard around and around, so that it whirls
when you drop in the fritters, causes them to assume a round shape
like balls.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNELONS, OR FRIED PUFFS.</b></p>
<p>Half a pound of puff paste, apricot or any kind of preserve that
may be preferred, hot lard.</p>
<p>Cannelons, which are made of puff paste rolled very thin, with
jam enclosed, and cut out in long, narrow rolls or puffs, make a
very pretty and elegant dish. Make some good puff paste, roll it
out very thin, and cut it into pieces of an equal size, about two
inches wide and eight inches long; place upon each piece a spoonful
of jam, wet the edges with the white of egg and fold the paste over
<i>twice</i>; slightly press the edges together, that the jam may
not escape in the frying, and when all are prepared, fry them in
boiling lard until of a nice brown, letting them remain by the side
of the fire after they are colored, that the paste may be
thoroughly done. Drain them before the fire, dish on a d'oyley,
sprinkle over them sifted sugar and serve. These cannelons are very
delicious made with fresh instead of preserved fruit, such as
strawberries, raspberries or currants; they should be laid in the
paste, plenty of pounded sugar sprinkled over and folded and fried
in the same manner as stated above.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 269]</span><a name='Page_269' id=

<p><b>GERMAN FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Take slices of stale bread cut in rounds or stale cake; fry them
in hot lard, like crullers, to a <i>light</i> brown. Dip each slice
when fried in boiling milk, to remove the grease; drain quickly,
dust with powdered sugar or spread with preserves. Pile on a hot
plate and serve. Sweet wine sauce poured over them is very
nice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOMINY FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Take one pint of hot boiled hominy, two eggs, half a teaspoonful
of salt and a tablespoonful of flour; thin it a little with cold
milk; when cold add a teaspoonful of baking powder, mix thoroughly,
drop tablespoonfuls of it into hot fat and fry to a delicate
brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PARSNIP FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Take three or four good-sized parsnips. Boil them until tender.
Mash and season with a little butter, a pinch of salt and a slight
sprinkling of pepper. Have ready a plate with some sifted flour on
it. Drop a tablespoonful of the parsnip in the flour and roll it
about until well coated and formed into a ball. When you have a
sufficient number ready, drop them into boiling drippings or lard,
as you would a fritter; fry a delicate brown and serve hot. Do not
put them in a covered dish, for that would steam them and deprive
them of their crispness, which is one of their great charms.</p>
<p>These are also very good fried in a frying pan with a small
quantity of lard and butter mixed, turning them over so as to fry
both sides brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN CORN FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>One pint of grated, young and tender, green corn, three eggs,
two tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, one tablespoonful of melted
butter, if milk is used, a teaspoonful of salt. Beat the eggs well,
add the corn by degrees, also the milk and butter; thicken with
just enough flour to hold them together, adding a teaspoonful of
baking powder to the flour. Have ready a kettle of hot lard, drop
the corn from the spoon into the fat and fry a light brown. They
are also nice fried in butter and lard mixed, the same as fried
eggs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM SHORT-CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Sift one quart of fine white flour, rub into it three
tablespoonfuls of cold butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a
tablespoonful of white sugar. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
270]</span><a name='Page_270' id="Page_270"></a>Add a beaten egg to
a cup of sour cream, turn it into the other ingredients, dissolve a
teaspoonful of soda in a spoonful of water, mix all together,
handling as little as possible; roll lightly into two round sheets,
place on pie-tins and bake from twenty to twenty-five minutes in a
quick oven.</p>
<p>This crust is delicious for fruit short-cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY SHORT-CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Make a rule of baking powder biscuit, with the exception of a
little more shortening; divide the dough in half; lay one-half on
the molding board (half the dough makes one short-cake), divide
this half again, and roll each piece large enough to cover a
biscuit-tin, or a large sized pie-tin; spread soft butter over the
lower one and place the other on top of that; proceed with the
other lump of dough the same, by cutting it in halves, and putting
on another tin. Set them in the oven; when sufficiently baked take
them out, separate each one by running a large knife through where
the cold soft butter was spread. Then butter plentifully each
crust, lay the bottom of each on earthen platters or dining-plates;
cover thickly with a quart of strawberries that have been
previously prepared with sugar, lay the top crusts on the fruit. If
there is any juice left pour it around the cake. This makes a
delicious short-cake.</p>
<p>Peaches, raspberries, blackberries and huckleberries can be
substituted for strawberries. Always send to the table with a
pitcher of sweet cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE SHORT-CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Peel two large oranges, chop them fine, remove the seeds, add
half a peeled lemon and one cup of sugar. Spread between the layers
of short-cake while it is hot.</p>

<h3>ICING THE CAKES.</h3>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON SHORT-CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Make a rich biscuit dough, same as above recipe. While baking,
take a cup and a quarter of water, a cup and a half of sugar, and
two lemons, peel, juice and pulp, throwing away the tough part of
the rind; boil this for some little time; then stir in three
crackers rolled fine; split the short-cakes while hot, spread with
butter, then with the mixture. To be eaten warm.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 271]</span><a name='Page_271' id=
"Page_271"></a>
<p><b>HUCKLEBERRY SHORT-CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, half a cupful of butter, one pint of sweet
milk, one tablespoonful of salt, two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking
powder sifted into a quart of flour, or enough to form a thick
batter; add a quart of the huckleberries; to be baked in a dripper;
cut into squares for the table and served hot with butter.
Blackberries may be used the same.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED DINNER-ROLLS.</b></p>
<p>When making light raised bread, save out a piece of dough nearly
the size of a small loaf. Roll it out on the board, spread a
tablespoonful of melted butter over it. Dissolve a quarter of a
teaspoonful of soda in a tablespoonful of water and pour that also
over it; work it all well into the dough, roll it out into a sheet
not quite half an inch thick. Cut it in strips three inches long
and one inch wide. Lay them on buttered tins, cover with a cloth
and set away in a cool place until an hour before dinner time; then
set them by the fire where they will become light. While they are
rising, add to a frying-pan a tablespoonful of cold butter and one
of lard; When it boils clear and is <i>hot</i>, lay as many of the
rolls in as will fry nicely. As soon as they brown on one side turn
them over and brown the other; then turn them on the edges and
brown the sides. Add fresh grease as is needed. Eat them warm in
place of bread. Nice with warm meat dinner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NEWPORT BREAKFAST-CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Take one quart of dough from the bread at an early hour in the
morning; break three eggs, separating yolks and whites, both to be
whipped to a light froth; mix them into the dough and gradually add
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one of sugar, one teaspoonful
of soda, and enough warm milk with it until it is a batter the
consistency of buckwheat cakes; beat it well and let it rise until
breakfast time. Have the griddle hot and nicely greased, pour on
the batter in small round cakes and bake a light brown, the same as
any griddle cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PUFF BALLS.</b></p>
<p>To a piece of butter as large as an egg stirred until soft; add
three well-beaten eggs, a pinch of salt and half a teacupful of
sour cream. Stir well together, then add enough flour to make a
very thick batter. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 272]</span><a name=
'Page_272' id="Page_272"></a>Drop a spoonful of this into boiling
water. Cook until the puffs rise to the surface. Dish them hot with
melted butter turned over them. Nice accompaniment to a meat dinner
as a side-dish&mdash;similar to plain macaroni.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAKFAST PUFFS.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of sour milk, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoonful
of salt, one egg and flour enough to roll out like biscuit dough.
Cut into narrow strips an inch wide and three inches long, fry
brown in hot lard like doughnuts. Serve hot; excellent with coffee.
Or fry in a spider with an ounce each of lard and butter, turning
and browning all four of the sides.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ENGLISH CRUMPETS.</b></p>
<p>One quart of warm milk, half a cup of yeast, one teaspoonful of
salt, flour enough to make a stiff batter; when light, add half a
cupful of melted butter, a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a
little water and a very little more flour; let it stand twenty
minutes or until light. Grease some muffin-rings, place them on a
hot griddle and fill them half full of the batter; when done on one
side turn and bake the other side. Butted them while hot; pile one
on another and serve immediately.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN CRUMPETS.</b></p>
<p>Mix together thoroughly while dry one quart of sifted flour,
loosely measured, two heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder and a
little salt; then add two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and sweet
milk enough to make a thin dough. Bake quickly in muffin-rings or
patty-pans.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PREPARED BREAD CRUMBS.</b></p>
<p>Take pieces of stale bread, break them in small bits, put them
on a baking pan and place them in a moderate oven, watching closely
that they do not scorch; then take them while hot and crisp and
roll them, crushing them. Sift them, using the fine crumbs for
breading cutlets, fish, croquettes, etc. The coarse ones may be
used for puddings, pancakes, etc.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRACKERS.</b></p>
<p>Sift into a pint of flour a heaping teaspoonful of baking
powder, four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoonful
salt and the white of an egg beaten and one cup of milk; mix it
with more flour, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 273]</span><a name=
'Page_273' id="Page_273"></a>enough to make a very stiff dough, as
stiff as can be rolled out; pounded and kneaded a long time. Roll
very thin like pie crust and cut out either round or square. Bake a
light brown.</p>
<p>Stale crackers are made crisp and better by placing them in the
oven a few moments before they are needed for the table.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH CRACKERS.</b></p>
<p>Six eggs, twelve tablespoonfuls of sweet milk, six
tablespoonfuls of butter, half a teaspoonful of soda; mold with
flour, pounding and working half an hour; roll it thin. Bake with
rather quick fire.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CORN MEAL MUSH OR HASTY PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Put two quarts of water into a clean dinner-pot or stewpan,
cover it and let it become boiling hot over the fire; then add a
tablespoonful of salt, take off the light scum from the top, have
sweet, fresh yellow or white corn meal; take a handful of the meal
with the left hand and a pudding-stick in the right, then with the
stick, stir the water around and by degrees let fall the meal; when
one handful is exhausted, refill it; continue to stir and add meal
until it is as thick as you can stir easily, or until the stick
will stand in it; stir it awhile longer; let the fire be gentle;
when it is sufficiently cooked, which will be in half an hour, it
will bubble or puff up; turn it into a deep basin. This is eaten
cold or hot, with milk or with butter and syrup or sugar, or with
meat and gravy, the same as potatoes or rice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED MUSH.</b></p>
<p>Make it like the above recipe, turn it into bread tins and when
cold slice it, dip each piece in flour and fry it in lard and
butter mixed in the frying pan, turning to brown well both sides.
Must be served hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRAHAM MUSH.</b></p>
<p>Sift Graham meal slowly into boiling salted water, stirring
briskly until thick as can be stirred with one hand; serve with
milk or cream and sugar, or butter and syrup. It will be improved
by removing from the kettle to a pan, as soon as thoroughly mixed,
and steaming three or four hours. It may also be eaten cold, or
sliced and fried, like corn meal mush.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 274]</span><a name='Page_274' id=

<p><b>OATMEAL.</b></p>
<p>Soak one cup of oatmeal in a quart of water over night, boil
half an hour in the morning, salted to taste. It is better to cook
it in a dish set into a dish of boiling water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RICE CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>Boil for thirty minutes one cup of well-washed rice in a pint of
milk; whip into the hot rice the following ingredients: Two ounces
of butter, two ounces of sugar, some salt, and when slightly cool
add the yolks of two eggs well beaten; if too stiff pour in a
little more milk; when cold, roll into small balls and dip in
beaten eggs, roll in fine cracker or bread crumbs, and fry same as
doughnuts. Or they may be fried in the frying pan, with a
tablespoonful each of butter and lard mixed, turning and frying
both sides brown. Serve very hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOMINY.</b></p>
<p>This form of cereal is very little known and consequently little
appreciated in most Northern households. "Big hominy" and "little
hominy," as they are called in the South, are staple dishes there
and generally take the place of oatmeal, which is apt to be too
heating for the climate. The former is called "samp" here. It must
be boiled for at least eight hours to be properly cooked, and may
then be kept on hand for two or three days and warmed over, made
into croquettes or balls, or fried in cakes. The fine hominy takes
two or three hours for proper cooking, and should be cooked in a
dish set into another of boiling water, and kept steadily boiling
until thoroughly soft.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOMINY CROQUETTES.</b></p>
<p>To a cupful of cold boiled hominy, add a teaspoonful of melted
butter, and stir it well, adding by degrees a cupful of milk, till
all is made into a soft, light paste; add a teaspoonful of white
sugar, a pinch of salt, and one well-beaten egg. Roll it into oval
balls with floured hands, dipped in beaten egg, then rolled in
cracker crumbs, and fry in hot lard.</p>
<p>The hominy is best boiled the day or morning before using.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 275]</span><a name='Page_275' id=
"Page_275"></a>
<p><b>BOILED RICE.</b></p>
<p>Take half or quarter of a pound of the best quality of rice;
wash it in a strainer, and put it in a saucepan, with a quart of
clean water and a pinch of salt; let it boil slowly till the water
is all evaporated&mdash;see that it does not burn&mdash;then pour
in a teacupful of new milk; stir carefully from the bottom of the
saucepan, so that the upper grain may go under, but do not smash
it; close the lid on your saucepan carefully down, and set it on a
cooler part of the fire, where it will not boil; as soon as it has
absorbed the added milk, serve it up with fresh new milk, adding
fruit and sugar for those who like them.</p>
<p>Another nice way to cook rice is to take one teacupful of rice
and one quart of milk, place in a steamer, and steam from two to
three hours; when nearly done, stir in a piece of butter as large
as the yolk of an egg, and a pinch of salt. You can use sugar if
you like. The difference in the time of cooking depends on your
rice&mdash;the older the rice, the longer it takes to cook.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SAMP, OR HULLED CORN.</b></p>
<p>An old-fashioned way of preparing hulled corn was to put a peck
of old, dry, ripe corn into a pot filled with water, and with it a
bag of hardwood ashes, say a quart. After soaking a while it was
boiled until the skins or hulls came off easily. The corn was then
washed in cold water to get rid of the taste of potash, and then
boiled until the kernels were soft. Another way was to take the lye
from the leaches where potash was made, dilute it, and boil the
corn in this until the skins or hulls came off. It makes a
delicious dish, eaten with milk or cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRACKED WHEAT.</b></p>
<p>Soak the wheat over night in cold water, about a quart of water
to a cup of wheat; cook it as directed for oatmeal; should be
thoroughly done. Eaten with sugar and cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OAT FLAKES.</b></p>
<p>This healthful oat preparation may be procured from the leading
grocers and is prepared as follows: Put into a double saucepan or
porcelain-lined pan a quart of boiling water, add a saltspoonful of
salt, and when it is boiling add, or rather stir in gradually,
three <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 276]</span><a name='Page_276' id=
"Page_276"></a>ounces of flakes. Keep stirring to prevent burning.
Let it boil from fifteen to twenty minutes and serve with cream and
sugar.</p>
<p>Ordinarily oatmeal requires two hours' steady cooking to make it
palatable and digestible. Wheaten grits and hominy one hour, but a
half hour longer cooking will not injure them and makes them easier
of digestion. Never be afraid of cooking cereals or preparations
from cereals too long, no matter what the directions on the package
may be.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEAMED OATMEAL.</b></p>
<p>To one teacupful oatmeal add a quart of cold water, a
teaspoonful of salt; put in a steamer over a kettle of cold water,
gradually heat and steam an hour and a half after it begins to
cook.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOMINY.</b></p>
<p>Hominy is a preparation of Indian corn, broken or ground, either
large or small, and is an excellent breakfast dish in winter or
summer. Wash the hominy thoroughly in on 3 or two waters, then
cover it with twice its depth of cold water and let it come to a
boil slowly. If it be the large hominy, simmer six hours; if the
small hominy, simmer two hours. When the water evaporates add hot
water; when done it may be eaten with cream, or allowed to become
cold and warmed up in the frying pan, using a little butter to
prevent burning.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Toast should be made of stale bread, or at least of bread that
has been baked a day. Cut smoothly in slices, not more than half an
inch thick; if the crust is baked very hard, trim the edges and
brown very evenly, but if it happens to burn, that should be
scraped off. Toast that is to be served with anything turned over
it, should have the slices first dipped quickly in a dish of hot
water turned from the boiling tea-kettle, with a little salt thrown
in. Cold biscuits cut in halves, and the under crust sliced off,
then browned evenly on both sides, make equally as good toast. The
following preparations of toast are almost all of them very nice
dishes, served with a family breakfast.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 277]</span><a name='Page_277' id=
"Page_277"></a>
<p><b>MILK TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Put over the fire a quart of milk, put into it a tablespoonful
of cold butter, stir a heaping teaspoonful of flour into half a
gill of milk; as soon as the milk on the fire boils, stir in the
flour, add a teaspoonful of salt; let all boil up once, remove from
the fire, and dip in this slices of toasted bread. When all are
used up, pour what is left of the scalded milk over the toast.
Cover and send to the table hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Heat a pint of milk to boiling and add a piece of butter the
size of an egg; stir a tablespoonful of flour smoothly into a cup
of rich cream, and add some of the boiling milk to this; heat it
gradually and prevent the flour from lumping; then stir into the
boiling milk and let it cook a few moments; salt to taste. After
taking from the fire stir in a beaten egg; strain the mixture on to
toast lightly buttered.</p>
<br>
<p><b>AMERICAN TOAST.</b></p>
<p>To one egg thoroughly beaten, put one cup of sweet milk and a
little salt. Slice light bread and dip into the mixture, allowing
each slice to absorb some of the milk; then brown on a hot buttered
griddle or thick-bottomed frying pan; spread with butter and serve
hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NUNS' TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Cut four or five hard-boiled eggs into slices. Put a piece of
butter half the size of an egg into a saucepan and when it begins
to bubble add a finely chopped onion. Let the onion cook a little
without taking color, then stir in a teaspoonful of flour. Add a
cupful of milk and stir until it becomes smooth; then put in the
slices of eggs and let them get hot. Pour over neatly trimmed
slices of hot buttered toast. The sauce must be seasoned to taste
with pepper and salt.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHEESE TOAST. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Toast thin slices of bread an even, crisp brown. Place on a warm
plate, allowing one small slice to each person, and pour on enough
melted cheese to cover them. Rich new cheese is best. Serve while
warm. Many prefer a little prepared mustard spread over the toast
before putting on the cheese.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 278]</span><a name='Page_278' id=
"Page_278"></a>
<p><b>CHEESE TOAST. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Put half an ounce of butter in a frying pan; when hot add
gradually four ounces of mild American cheese. Whisk it thoroughly
until melted. Beat together half a pint of cream and two eggs;
whisk into the cheese, add a little salt, pour over the crisp
toast, and serve.</p>
<p>The two above recipes are usually called "Welsh Rarebit."</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Select the large ones, used for frying, and first dip them in
beaten egg, then in either cracker or bread crumbs and cook upon a
fine wire gridiron, over a quick fire. Toast should be made ready
in advance, and a rich cream sauce poured over the whole. After
pouring on the sauce, finely cut celery strewn over the top adds to
their delicacy.</p>
<p>Or wash oysters in the shell and put them on hot coals, or upon
the top of a hot stove, or bake them in a hot oven; open the shells
with an oyster-knife, taking care to lose none of the liquor. Dip
the toast into hot, salted water quickly and turn out the oyster
and liquor over the toast; season with salt and pepper and a
teaspoonful of melted butter over each.</p>
<p>Oysters steamed in the shell are equally as good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MUSHROOMS ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Peel a quart of mushrooms and cut off a little of the root end.
Melt an ounce of butter in the frying pan and fry in it half a
pound of raw minced steak; add two saltspoonfuls of salt, a pinch
of cayenne and a gill of hot water; fry until the juices are
extracted from the meat; tilt the pan and squeeze the meat with the
back of the spoon until there is nothing left but dry meat, then
remove it; add the mushrooms to the liquid and if there is not
enough of it, add more butter; toss them about a moment and pour
out on hot toast.</p>
<p>Some add a little sherry to the dish before removing from the
fire.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Pare and stew a quart of ripe tomatoes until smooth. Season with
salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of butter. When done, add one cup
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 279]</span><a name='Page_279' id=
"Page_279"></a>sweet cream and a little flour. Let it scald, but
not boil; remove at once. Pour over slices of dipped toast, well
buttered.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGGS ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Various preparations of eggs can be served on toast, first
dipping slices of well-toasted bread quickly in hot salted water,
then turning over them scrambled, poached or creamed eggs, all
found in the recipes among EGGS.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED EGGS ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Toast six slices of stale bread, dip them in hot salted water
and butter them lightly. After arranging them on a platter or deep
plate, break enough eggs to cover them, breaking one at a time and
slip over the toast so that they do not break; sprinkle over them
salt and pepper and turn over all some kind of thickened
gravy&mdash;either chicken or lamb, cream or a cream sauce made the
same as "White Sauce;" turn this over the toast and eggs and bake
in a hot oven until the eggs are set, or about five minutes. Serve
at once.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HAM TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Take a quarter of a pound of either boiled or fried ham, chop it
fine, mix it with the yolks of two eggs, well beaten, a
tablespoonful of butter, and enough cream or rich milk to make it
soft, a dash of pepper. Stir it over the fire until it thickens.
Dip the toast for an instant in hot salted water; spread over some
melted butter, then turn over the ham mixture. Serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>REED BIRDS ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Remove the feathers and legs of a dozen reed birds, split them
down the back, remove the entrails, and place them on a double
broiler; brush a little melted butter over them and broil the inner
side thoroughly first; then lightly broil the other side. Melt one
quarter of a pound of butter, season it nicely with salt and
pepper, dip the birds in it, and arrange them nicely on slices of
toast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MINCED FOWLS ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Remove from the bones all the meat of either cold roast or
boiled fowls. Clean it from the skin, and keep covered from the air
until ready for use. Boil the bones and skin with three-fourths of
a pint of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 280]</span><a name='Page_280'
id="Page_280"></a>water until reduced quite half. Strain the gravy
and let it cool. Next, having skimmed off the fat, put it into a
clean saucepan with half a cup of cream, three tablespoonfuls of
butter, well mixed with a tablespoonful of flour. Keep these
stirred until they boil. Then put in the fowl finely minced, with
three hard-boiled eggs, chopped, and sufficient salt and pepper to
season. Shake the mince over the fire until just ready to serve.
Dish it over hot toast and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HASHED BEEF ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Chop a quantity of cold roast beef rather fine and season it
well with pepper and salt. For each pint of meat add a level
tablespoonful of flour. Stir well and add a small teacupful of
soup-stock or water. Put the mixture into a small stewpan and,
after covering it, simmer for twenty minutes. Meanwhile, toast half
a dozen slices of bread nicely and at the end of the twenty minutes
spread the meat upon them. Serve at once on a hot dish. In case
water be used instead of soup-stock, add a tablespoonful of butter
just before spreading the beef upon the toast. Any kind of cold
meat may be prepared in a similar manner.</p>

<br>
<p><b>VEAL HASH ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Take a teacupful of boiling water in a saucepan, stir in an even
teaspoonful of flour, wet in a tablespoonful of cold water, and let
it boil five minutes; add one-half teaspoonful of black pepper, as
much salt and two tablespoonfuls of butter, and let it keep hot,
but not boil. Chop the veal fine and mix with it half as much stale
bread crumbs. Put it in a pan and pour the gravy over it, then let
it simmer ten minutes. Serve this on buttered toast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CODFISH ON TOAST. (Cuban Style.)</b></p>
<p>Take a teacupful of freshened codfish picked up fine. Fry a
sliced onion in a tablespoonful of butter; when it has turned a
light brown, put in the fish with water enough to cover it; add
half a can of tomatoes, or half a dozen of fresh ones. Cook all
nearly an hour, seasoning with a little pepper. Serve on slices of
dipped toast, hot. Very fine.</p>
<p>Plain creamed codfish is very nice turned over dipped toast.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 281]</span><a name='Page_281' id=
"Page_281"></a>
<p><b>HALIBUT ON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Put into boiling salted water one pound of fresh halibut; cook
slowly for fifteen minutes, or until done; remove from the water
and chop it fine; then add half a cup of melted butter and eight
eggs well beaten. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Place over the fire a thick-bottomed frying pan containing a
tablespoonful of cold butter; when it begins to melt, tip the pan
so as to grease the sides; then put in the fish and eggs and stir
one way until the eggs are cooked, but not <i>too</i> hard. Turn
over toast dipped in hot salted water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN HASH WITH RICE TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Boil a cup of rice the night before; put it into a square,
narrow bread-pan, set it in the ice-box. Next morning cut it in
half inch slices, rub over each slice a little warm butter and
toast them on a broiler to a delicate brown. Arrange the toast on a
warm platter and turn over the whole a chicken hash made from the
remains of cold fowl, the meat picked from the bones, chopped fine,
put into the frying pan with butter and a little water to moisten
it, adding pepper and salt. Heat hot all through. Serve
immediately.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Cut six apples into quarters, take the core out, peel and cut
them in slices; put in the saucepan an ounce of butter, then throw
over the apples about two ounces of white powdered sugar and two
tablespoonfuls of water; put the saucepan on the fire, let it stew
quickly, toss them up, or stir with a spoon; a few minutes will do
them. When tender cut two or three slices of bread half an inch
thick; put in a frying pan two ounces of butter, put on the fire;
when the butter is melted put in your bread, which fry of a nice
yellowish color; when nice and crisp take them out, place them on a
dish, a little white sugar over, the apples about an inch thick.
Serve hot.</p>

<h2><b>CAKES.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO CAKE-MAKING.</b></p>
<p>Use none but the best materials, and all the ingredients should
be properly prepared before commencing to mix any of them. Eggs
beat up much lighter and sooner by being placed in a cold place
sometime before using them; a small pinch of soda sometimes has the
same effect. Flour should always be sifted before using it. Cream
of tartar or baking powder should be thoroughly mixed with the
flour; butter be placed where it will become moderately soft, but
<i>not</i> melted in the least, or the cake will be sodden and
heavy. Sugar should be rolled and sifted; spices ground or pounded;
raisins or any ether fruit looked over and prepared; currants,
especially, should be nicely washed, picked, dried in a cloth and
then carefully examined, that no pieces of grit or stone may be
left amongst them. They should then be laid on a dish before the
fire to become thoroughly dry; as, if added damp to the other
ingredients, cakes will be liable to be heavy.</p>
<p>Eggs should be well beaten, the whites and yolks separately, the
yolks to a thick cream, the whites until they are a stiff froth.
Always stir the butter and sugar to a cream, then add the beaten
yolks, then the milk, the flavoring, then the beaten whites, and,
lastly, the flour. If fruit is to be used, measure and dredge with
a little sifted flour, stir in gradually and thoroughly.</p>
<p>Pour all in well-buttered cake-pans. While the cake is baking
care should be taken that no cold air enters the oven, only when
necessary to see that the cake is baking properly; the oven should
be an even, moderate heat, not too cold or too hot; much depends on
this for success. Cake is often spoiled by being looked at too
often when first put into the oven. The heat should be tested
before the cake is put in, which can be done by throwing on the
floor of the oven a tablespoonful <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
283]</span><a name='Page_283' id="Page_283"></a>of new flour. If
the flour takes fire, or assumes a dark brown color, the
temperature is too high and the oven must be allowed to cool; if
the flour remains white after the lapse of a few seconds, the
temperature is too low. When the oven is of the proper temperature
the flour will slightly brown and look slightly scorched.</p>
<p>Another good way to test the heat, is to drop a few spoonfuls of
the cake batter on a small piece of buttered letter paper, and
place it in the oven during the finishing of the cake, so that the
piece will be baked before putting in the whole cake; if the little
drop of cake batter bakes evenly without burning around the edge,
it will be safe to put the whole cake in the oven. Then, again, if
the oven seems too hot, fold a thick brown paper double, and lay on
the bottom of the oven; then after the cake has risen, put a thick
brown paper over the top, or butter well a thick white paper and
lay carefully over the top.</p>
<p>If, after the cake is put in, it seems to bake too fast, put a
brown paper loosely over the top of the pan, care being taken that
it does not touch the cake, and do not open the door for five
minutes at least; the cake should then be quickly examined, and the
door shut carefully, or the rush of cold air will cause it to fall.
Setting a <i>small dish</i> of hot water in the oven, will also
prevent the cake from scorching.</p>
<p>To ascertain when the cake is done, run a broom straw into the
middle of it; if it comes out clean and smooth, the cake will do to
take out.</p>
<p>Where the recipe calls for baking powder, and you have none, you
can use cream of tartar and soda in proportion to one level
teaspoonful of soda, two heaping teaspoonfuls of cream of
tartar.</p>
<p>When sour milk is called for in the recipe, use only soda. Cakes
made with molasses burn much more easily than those made with
sugar. Never stir cake after the butter and sugar is creamed, but
beat it down from the bottom, up and over; this laps air into the
cake batter, and produces little air cells, which cause the dough
to puff and swell when it comes in contact with the heat while
cooking.</p>
<p>When making most cakes, especially sponge cake, the flour should
be added by degrees, stirred very slowly and lightly, for if
stirred hard and fast it will make it porous and tough.</p>
<p>Cakes should be kept in tight tin cake-cans, or earthen jars, in
a cool, dry place.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 284]</span><a name='Page_284' id=
"Page_284"></a>
<p>Cookies, jumbles, ginger-snaps, etc., require a quick oven; if
they become moist or soft by keeping, put again into the oven a few
minutes.</p>
<p>To remove a cake from a tin after it is baked, so that it will
not crack, break or fall, first butter the tin well all around the
sides and bottom; then cut a piece of letter paper to exactly fit
the tin, butter that on both sides, placing it smoothly on the
bottom and sides of the tin. When the cake is baked, let it remain
in the tin until it is <i>cold</i>; then set it in the oven a
minute, or just long enough to warm the tin through. Remove it from
the oven; turn it upside down on your hand, tap the edge of the tin
on the table and it will slip out with ease, leaving it whole.</p>
<p>If a cake-pan is too shallow for holding the quantity of cake to
be baked, for fear of its being so light as to rise above the pan,
that can be remedied by thoroughly greasing a piece of thick glazed
letter paper with soft butter. Place or fit it around the sides of
the buttered tin, allowing it to reach an inch or more above the
top. If the oven heat is moderate the butter will preserve the
paper from burning.</p>

<a name='FROSTING_OR_ICING' id="FROSTING_OR_ICING"></a>
<h2><b>FROSTING OR ICING.</b></h2>
<p>In the first place, the eggs should be cold, and the platter on
which they are to be beaten also cold. Allow, for the white of one
egg, one small teacupful of powdered sugar. Break the eggs and
throw a small handful of the sugar on them as soon as you begin
beating; keep adding it at intervals until it is all used up. The
eggs must <i>not</i> be beaten until the sugar has been added in
this way, which gives a smooth, tender frosting, and one that will
dry much sooner than the old way.</p>
<p>Spread with a broad knife evenly over the cake, and if it seems
too thin, beat in a little more sugar. Cover the cake with two
coats, the second after the first has become dry, or nearly so. If
the icing gets too dry or stiff before the last coat is needed, it
can be thinned sufficiently with a little water, enough to make it
work smoothly.</p>
<p>A little lemon juice, or half a teaspoonful of tartaric acid,
added to the frosting while being beaten, makes it white and more
frothy.</p>
<p>The flavors mostly used are lemon, vanilla, almond, rose,
chocolate and orange. If you wish to ornament with figures or
flowers, make up rather more icing, keep about one-third out until
that on the cake is <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 285]</span><a name=
'Page_285' id="Page_285"></a>dried; then, with a clean glass
syringe, apply it in such forms as you desire and dry as before;
what you keep out to ornament with may be tinted pink with
cochineal, blue with indigo, yellow with saffron or the grated rind
of an orange strained through a cloth, green with spinach juice and
brown with chocolate, purple with cochineal and indigo. Strawberry,
or currant and cranberry juices color a delicate pink.</p>
<p>Set the cake in a cool oven with the door open to dry, or in a
draught in an open window.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALMOND FROSTING.</b></p>
<p>The whites of three eggs, beaten up with three cups of fine,
white sugar. Blanch a pound of sweet almonds, pound them in a
mortar with a little sugar, until a fine paste, then add the whites
of eggs, sugar and vanilla extract. Pound a few minutes to
thoroughly mix. Cover the cake with a very thick coating of this,
set in a cool oven to dry, afterwards cover with a plain icing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE FROSTING.</b></p>
<p>The whites of four eggs, three cups of powdered sugar and nearly
a cup of grated chocolate. Beat the whites a very little, they must
not become white, stir in the chocolate, then put in the sugar
gradually, beating to mix it well.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN CHOCOLATE ICING.</b></p>
<p>Put into a shallow pan four tablespoonfuls of scraped chocolate,
and place it where it will melt gradually, but not scorch; when
melted, stir in three tablespoonfuls of milk or cream and one of
water; mix all well together, and add one scant teacupful of sugar;
boil about five minutes, and while hot, and when the cakes are
nearly cold, spread some evenly over the surface of one of the
cakes; put a second one on top, alternating the mixture and cakes;
then cover top and sides, and set in a warm oven to harden. All who
have tried recipe after recipe, vainly hoping to find one where the
chocolate sticks to the cake and not to the fingers, will
appreciate the above. In making those most palatable of cakes,
"Chocolate Eclairs," the recipe just given will be found very
satisfactory.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 286]</span><a name='Page_286' id=
"Page_286"></a>
<p><b>TUTTI FRUTTI ICING.</b></p>
<p>Mix with boiled icing one ounce each of chopped citron, candied
cherries, seedless raisins, candied pineapple and blanched
almonds.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUGAR ICING.</b></p>
<p>To one pound of extra refined sugar add one ounce of fine white
starch; pound finely together and then sift them through gauze;
then beat the whites of three eggs to a froth. The secret of
success is to beat the eggs long enough, and always one way; add
the powdered sugar by degrees, or it will spoil the froth of the
eggs. When all the sugar is stirred in continue the whipping for
half an hour longer, adding more sugar if the ice is too thin. Take
a little of the icing and lay it aside for ornamenting afterward.
When the cake comes out of the oven, spread the sugar icing
smoothly over it with a knife and dry it at once in a cool oven.
For ornamenting the cake the icing may be tinged any color
preferred. For pink, use a few drops of cochineal; for yellow, a
pinch of saffron dissolved; for green, the juice of some chopped
spinach. Whichever is chosen, let the coloring be first mixed with
a little colorless spirit and then stirred into the white icing
until the tint is deep enough. To ornament the cake with it, make a
cone of stiff writing paper and squeeze the colored icing through
it, so as to form leaves, beading or letters, as the case may be.
It requires nicety and care to do it with success.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED FROSTING.</b></p>
<p>To one pound of finest pulverized sugar add three wine-glassfuls
of clear water. Let it stand until it dissolves; then boil it until
it is perfectly clear and threads from the spoon. Beat well the
whites of four eggs. Pour the sugar into the dish with the eggs,
but do not mix them until the syrup is luke-warm; then beat all
well together for one-half hour.</p>
<p>Season to your taste with vanilla, rose-water, or lemon juice.
The first coating may be put on the cake as soon as it is well
mixed. Rub the cake with a little flour before you apply the icing.
While the first coat is drying continue to beat the remainder; you
will not have to wait long if the cake is set in a warm place near
the fire. This is said to be a most excellent recipe for icing.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 287]</span><a name='Page_287' id=
"Page_287"></a>
<p><b>FROSTING WITHOUT EGGS.</b></p>
<p>An excellent frosting may be made without eggs or gelatine,
which will keep longer and cut more easily, causing no breakage or
crumbling and withal is very economical.</p>
<p>Take one cup of granulated sugar; dampen it with one-fourth of a
cup of milk, or five tablespoonfuls; place it on the fire in a
suitable dish and stir it until it boils; then let it boil for five
minutes without stirring; remove it from the fire and set the dish
in another of cold water; add flavoring. While it is cooling, stir
or beat it constantly and it will become a thick, creamy
frosting.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GELATINE FROSTING.</b></p>
<p>Soak one teaspoonful of gelatine in one tablespoonful of cold
water half an hour, dissolve in two tablespoonfuls of hot water;
add one cup of powdered sugar and stir until smooth.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOLDEN FROSTING.</b></p>
<p>A very delicious and handsome frosting can be made by using the
yolks of eggs instead of the whites. Proceed exactly as for
ordinary frosting. It will harden just as nicely as that does. This
is particularly good for orange cake, harmonizing with the color of
the cake in a way to please those who love rich coloring.</p>

<h2><b>FILLINGS FOR LAYER CAKES.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>No. 1. CREAM FILLING.</b></p>
<p>Cream filling is made with one pint of new milk, two eggs, three
tablespoonfuls of sifted flour (or half cup of cornstarch), one cup
of sugar. Put two-thirds of the milk on the stove to boil, stir the
sugar, flour and eggs in what is left. When the milk boils, put
into it the whole and cook it until it is as thick as custard; when
cool, add vanilla extract. This custard is nice with a cup of
hickory nuts, kernels chopped fine and stirred into it. Spread
between the layers of cake. This custard can be made of the yolks
of the eggs only, saving the whites for the cake part.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 288]</span><a name='Page_288' id=
"Page_288"></a>
<p><b>No. 2. ANOTHER CREAM FILLING.</b></p>

pour this, boiling hot, over the <i>well-beaten</i> whites of three
eggs; stir the mixture very briskly, and pour the sugar in slowly;
beat it, when all in, until cool. Flavor with lemon or vanilla
extract. This, spread between any white cake layers, answers for
"Ice-Cream Cake."</p>
<br>
<p><b>No. 4. APPLE FILLING.</b></p>
<p>Peel and slice green tart apples, put them on the fire with
sugar to suit; when tender, remove, rub them through a fine sieve

<p><b>No. 6. CREAM FROSTING.</b></p>
<p>A cup of sweet thick cream whipped, sweetened and flavored with
vanilla; cut a loaf of cake in two, spread the frosting between and
on the top; this tastes like Charlotte Russe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>No. 7. PEACH-CREAM FILLING.</b></p>
<p>Cut peaches into thin slices, or chop them and prepare cream by
whipping and sweetening. Put a layer of peaches between the layers

mixed, having beaten the egg well before adding it; then add the
vanilla flavoring after it is removed from the fire.</p>
<br>
<p><b>No. 9. ANOTHER CHOCOLATE FILLING.</b></p>
<p>The whites of three eggs beaten stiff, one cup of sugar and one
cup of grated chocolate, put between the layers and on top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>No. 10. BANANA FILLING.</b></p>
<p>Make an icing of the whites of two eggs and one cup and a half
of powdered sugar. Spread this on the layers, and then cover
thickly and entirely with bananas sliced thin or chopped fine. This
cake may be flavored with vanilla. The top should be simply
frosted.</p>

<p>Four tablespoonfuls of <i>very finely</i> chopped citron, four
tablespoonfuls of finely chopped seeded raisins, half a cupful of
blanched almonds chopped fine, also a quarter of a pound of finely
chopped figs. Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth,
adding half of a cupful of sugar; then mix thoroughly into this the
whole of the chopped ingredients. Put it between the layers of cake
when the cake is <i>hot</i>, so that it will cook the egg a little.

<p>Two cupfuls of raised dough; beat into it two-thirds of a cup of
butter and two cups of sugar creamed together, three eggs, well
beaten, one even teaspoonful of soda dissolved in two
tablespoonfuls of milk, half a nutmeg grated, one tablespoonful of
cinnamon, a teaspoonful of cloves, one cup of raisins. Mix all well
together, put in the beaten whites of eggs and raisins last; beat
all hard for several minutes; put in buttered pans and let it stand

cinnamon, two nutmegs, one wine-glass of wine, one wine-glass of
brandy, one coffeecupful molasses with the spices in it; steep this
gently twenty or thirty minutes, not boiling hot; beat the eggs
very lightly; put the fruit in last, stirring it gradually, also a
teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a tablespoonful of water; the
fruit should be well floured; if necessary add flour after the
fruit is in; butter a sheet of paper and lay it in the pan. Lay in
some slices of citron, then a layer of the mixture, then of citron
again, etc., till the pan is nearly full. Bake <span class=

thoroughly, and then add four cupfuls of sifted flour alternately
with the beaten whites of eggs. Now dissolve a level teaspoonful of
soda and stir in thoroughly. Mix the fruit together and stir into
it two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour; then stir it in the cake.
Butter two common-sized baking tins carefully, line them with

<p><b>WHITE FRUIT CAKE.</b></p>
<p>One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, one cup of sweet milk, two
and one-half cups of flour, the whites of seven eggs, two even
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one pound each of seeded raisins,
figs and blanched almonds, and one quarter of a pound of citron,
all chopped fine. Mix all thoroughly before adding the fruit; add a
teaspoonful of lemon extract. Put baking powder in the flour and
mix it well before adding it to the other ingredients. Sift a
little flour over the fruit before stirring it in. Bake slowly two
hours and try with a splint to see when it is done. A cup of grated
cocoanut is a nice addition to this cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOLASSES FRUIT CAKE.</b></p>
<p>One teacupful of butter, one teacupful of brown sugar, worked
well together; next, two teacupfuls of cooking molasses, one cupful
of milk with a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in it, one
tablespoonful of ginger, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
292]</span><a name='Page_292' id="Page_292"></a>one tablespoonful
of cinnamon and one teaspoonful of cloves a little grated nutmeg.
Now add four eggs well beaten and five cups of sifted flour, or
enough to make a stiff batter. Flour a cup of raisins and one of
currants; add last. Bake in a very <i>moderate</i> oven one hour.
If well covered will keep six months.</p>
<p><b>SPONGE CAKE.</b></p>
<p>SEPARATE the whites and yolks of six eggs. Beat the yolks to a
cream, to which add two teacupfuls of powdered sugar, beating again
from five to ten minutes, then add two tablespoonfuls of milk or
water, a pinch of salt and flavoring. Now add part of the beaten
whites; then two cups of flour in which you have sifted two
teaspoonfuls of baking powder; mix gradually into the above
ingredients, stirring slowly and lightly, only enough to mix them
well; lastly add the remainder of the whites of the eggs. Line the
tins with buttered paper and fill two-thirds full.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHITE SPONGE CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Whites of five eggs, one cup of flour, one cup sugar, one
teaspoonful baking powder; flavor with vanilla. Bake in a quick
oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALMOND SPONGE CAKE.</b></p>
<p>The addition of almonds makes this cake very superior to the
usual sponge cake. Sift one pint of fine flour; blanch in scalding
water two ounces of sweet and two ounces of bitter almonds,
renewing the hot water when expedient; when the skins are all off
wash the almonds in cold water (mixing the sweet and bitter) and
wipe them dry; pound them to a fine, smooth paste (one at a time),
adding, as you proceed, water or white of egg to prevent their
boiling. Set them in a cool place; beat ten eggs, the whites and
yolks separately, till very smooth and thick, and then beat into
them gradually two cups powdered sugar in turn with the pounded
almonds; lastly, add the flour, stirring it round slowly and
lightly on the surface of the mixture, as in common sponge cake;
have ready buttered a <i>deep</i> square pan; put the mixture
carefully into it, set into the oven and bake till thoroughly done
and risen very high; when cool, cover it with plain white icing
flavored with rose-water, or with almond icing. With sweet almonds
always use a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 293]</span><a name=
'Page_293' id="Page_293"></a>small portion of bitter; without them,
<i>sweet</i> almonds have little or no taste, though they add to
the richness of the cake.</p>
<p>Use two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder in the flour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OLD-FASHIONED SPONGE CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of sifted white sugar, two cups of flour measured
before sifting, ten eggs. Stir the yolks and sugar together until
perfectly light; add a pinch of salt; beat the whites of the eggs
to a very stiff froth and add them with the flour, after beating
together lightly; flavor with lemon. Bake in a <i>moderate</i> oven
about forty-five minutes. Baking powder is an improvement to this
cake, using two large teaspoonfuls.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON SPONGE CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Into one level cup of flour put a level teaspoonful of baking
powder and sift it. Grate off the yellow rind of a lemon. Separate
the whites from the yolks of four eggs. Measure a scant cup of
white granulated sugar and beat it to a cream with the yolks, then
add the grated rind and a tablespoonful of the juice of the lemon.
Stir together until thick and creamy; now beat the whites to a
stiff froth; then quickly and lightly mix <i>without beating</i> a
third of the flour with the yolks; then a third of the whites; then
more flour and whites until all are used. The mode of mixing must
be very light, rather cutting down through the cake batter than to
beating it; beating the eggs makes them light, but beating the
batter makes the cake tough. Bake immediately until a straw run
into it can be withdrawn clean.</p>
<p>This recipe is especially nice for Charlotte Russe, being so
light and porous.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN SPONGE CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Beat the yolks of four eggs together with two cups of fine
powdered sugar. Stir in gradually one cup of sifted flour and the
whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, then a cup of sifted
flour in which two teaspoonfuls of baking powder have been stirred,
and, lastly, a scant teacupful of boiling water, stirred in a
little at a time. Flavor, add salt and, however thin the mixture
may seem, do not add any more flour. Bake in shallow tins.</p>

<p><b>BRIDE'S CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Cream together one scant cup of butter and three cups of sugar;
add one cup of milk, then the beaten whites of twelve eggs; sift
three teaspoonfuls of baking powder into one cup of cornstarch
mixed with three cups of sifted flour and beat in gradually with
the rest; flavor to taste. Beat all thoroughly, then put in
buttered tins lined with letter paper well buttered; bake slowly in
a <i>moderate</i> oven. A beautiful white cake. Ice the top. Double
the recipe if more is required.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ENGLISH POUND CAKE.</b></p>
<p>One pound of butter, one and one-quarter pounds of flour, one
pound of pounded loaf sugar, one pound of currants, nine eggs, two
ounces of candied peel, one-half ounce of citron, one-half ounce of
sweet almonds; when liked, a little pounded mace. Work the butter
to a cream; add the sugar, then the well-beaten yolks of eggs, next
the flour, currants, candied peel, which should be cut into neat
slices, and the almonds, which should be blanched and chopped, and
mix all these well together; whisk the whites of eggs and let them
be thoroughly blended with the other ingredients. Beat the cake
well for twenty minutes and put it into a round tin, lined at the
bottom and sides with strips of white buttered paper. Bake it from
two hours to two and a half, and let the oven be well heated when
the cake is first put in, as, if this is not the case, the currants
will all sink to the bottom of it. A glass of wine is usually added
to the mixture, but this is scarcely necessary, as the cake will be
found quite rich enough without it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN POUND CAKE.</b></p>
<p>This is the old-fashioned recipe that our mothers used to make,
and it can be kept for weeks in an earthen jar, closely covered,
first dipping letter paper in brandy and placing over the top of
the cake before covering the jar.</p>
<p>Beat to a cream one pound of butter with one pound of sugar,
after mixing well with the beaten yolks of twelve eggs, one grated
nutmeg, one glass of wine, one glass of rose-water. Then stir in
one pound of sifted flour and the well-beaten whites of the eggs.
Bake a nice light brown.</p>

cocoanut grated. Line the cake-pans with paper well buttered, fill
rather more than half full and bake in a <i>moderate</i> oven.
Spread over the top a thin frosting, sprinkled thickly with grated
cocoanut.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CITRON POUND CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Stir two cups of butter to a cream, then beat in the following
ingredients each one in succession: one pint of powdered sugar, one
quart of flour, a teaspoonful of salt; eight eggs, the yolks and
whites beaten separately, and a wine-glass of brandy; then last of
all add a quarter of a pound of citron cut into thin slices and
floured. Line two cake pans with buttered paper and turn the cake
batter in. Bake in a <i>moderate</i> oven about three-quarters of
an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CITRON CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Three cups of white sugar and one cup of butter creamed

butter to a cream, then add the milk and flavoring, part of the
flour, the beaten whites of eggs, then the rest of the flour. Bake
carefully in tins lined with buttered white paper.</p>
<p>When using the whites of eggs for nice cakes, the yolks need not
be wasted; keep them in a cool place and scramble them. Serve on
toast or with chipped beef.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOLD CAKE.</b></p>
<p>After beating to a cream one cup and a half of butter and two
cups of white sugar, stir in the well-whipped yolks of one dozen

powder. Flavor with lemon. Line the bake-pans with buttered paper
and bake in a moderate oven for one hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOLD OR LEMON CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of sugar, half a cup of butter, the yolks of six eggs
and one whole one, the grated rind and juice of a lemon or orange,
half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in half a cup of sweet milk,
four cups of sifted flour, sifted twice; cream the butter and
sugar, then add the beaten yolks and the flour, beating hard for
several minutes. Lastly, add the lemon or orange and bake, frosting
if liked. This makes a more suitable <i>lemon</i> cake than if made

cups butter, three eggs, half a nutmeg, one tablespoonful cinnamon,
one pound raisins, a gill of brandy.</p>
<p>Brown sugar is much better than white for this kind of cake, and
it is improved by dissolving a half-teaspoonful of soda in a

stir this into the cake, add flavoring, then the remaining beaten
whites of egg. Bake in layers like jelly cake. Make an icing for
the filling, using the whites of four eggs beaten to a very stiff
froth, with two cups of fine white sugar and the juice of half a

carefully, adding three teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract. After this
add the flour, stirring quickly and lightly. Pour it into a clean,
bright tin cake-dish, which should <i>not</i> be buttered or lined.
Bake at once in a moderate oven about forty minutes, testing it
with a broom splint. When done let it remain in the cake-tin,
turning it upside down, with the sides resting on the tops of two

<p>This cake is made from the same recipe as marble cake, only make
double the quantity of the white part, and divide it in one-half;
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 303]</span><a name='Page_303' id=
"Page_303"></a>put into it a very little cochineal. It will be a
delicate pink. Bake in jelly-cake tins and lay first the white,
then the dark, then the pink one on top of the others; put together
with frosting between. It makes quite a fancy cake. Frost the top
when cool.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOLDEN SPICE CAKE.</b></p>
<p>This cake can be made to advantage when you have the yolks of
eggs left, after having used the whites in making white cake. Take
the yolks of seven eggs and one whole egg, two cupfuls of brown
sugar, one cupful of molasses, one cupful of butter, one large
coffeecupful of sour milk, one teaspoonful of soda (just even full)
and five cupfuls of flour, one teaspoonful of ground cloves, two
teaspoonfuls of cinnamon, two teaspoonfuls of ginger, one nutmeg
and a small pinch of cayenne pepper; beat eggs, sugar and butter to
a light batter before putting in the molasses, then add the
molasses, flour and milk; beat it well together and bake in a
<i>moderate</i> oven; if fruit is used, take two cupfuls of
raisins, flour them well and put them in last.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALMOND CAKE.</b></p>
<p>One-half cupful butter, two cupfuls sugar, four eggs, one-half
cupful almonds, blanched&mdash;by pouring water on them until skins
easily slip off&mdash;and cut in fine shreds, one-half teaspoonful
extract bitter almonds, one pint flour, one and one-half
teaspoonful baking powder, one glass brandy, one-half cupful milk.
Rub butter and sugar to a smooth white cream; add eggs, one at a
time, beating three or four minutes between each. Sift flour and
powder together, add to the butter, etc., with almonds, extract of
bitter almonds, brandy and milk; mix into a smooth, medium batter;
bake carefully in a rather hot oven twenty minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROCHESTER JELLY CAKE.</b></p>
<p>One and one-half cups sugar, two eggs, one-half cup butter,
three-fourths cup milk, two heaping cups flour with one teaspoonful
cream of tartar, one-half teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in the
milk. Put half the above mixture in a small shallow tin, and to the
remainder add one teaspoonful molasses, one-half cup raisins
(chopped) or currants, one-half teaspoonful cinnamon, cloves,
allspice, a little nutmeg and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
304]</span><a name='Page_304' id="Page_304"></a>one tablespoonful
flour. Bake this in same kind of tins. Put the sheets of cake
together, while warm, with jelly between.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT LAYER CAKE.</b></p>
<p>This is a delicious novelty in cake-making. Take one cup of
sugar, half a cup of butter, one cup and a half of flour, half a
cup of wine, one cup of raisins, two eggs and half a teaspoonful of
soda; put these ingredients together with care; just as if it were
a very rich cake; bake it in three layers and put frosting
between&mdash;the frosting to be made of the whites of two eggs
with enough powdered sugar to make it thick. The top of the cake
may be frosted if you choose.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHIPPED CREAM CAKE.</b></p>
<p>One cup of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of soft butter stirred
together; add the yolks of two eggs well beaten, then add four
tablespoonfuls of milk, some flavoring, then the beaten whites of
the eggs. Mix a teaspoonful of cream of tartar and half a teaspoon
of soda in a cup of flour, sift it into the cake batter and stir
lightly. Bake in a small whipping-pan. When the cake is cool, have
ready half of a pint of sweet cream sweetened and whipped to a
stiff froth, also flavored. Spread it over the cake while fresh. To
whip the cream easily, set it on ice before whipping.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROLLED JELLY CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Three eggs, one teacup of fine sugar, one teacup of flour; beat
the yolks until light, then add the sugar, then add two
tablespoonfuls of water, a pinch of salt; lastly stir in the flour,
in which there should be a heaping teaspoonful of baking powder.
The flour added gradually. Bake in long, shallow biscuit-tins, well
greased. Turn out on a damp towel on a bread-board, cover the top
with jelly, and roll up while warm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CUT LAYER CAKE.</b></p>
<p>When cutting Layer Cakes, it is better to first make a round
hole in the cake with a knife or tin tube about an inch and a
quarter in diameter. This prevents the edge of the cake from
crumbling when cutting it.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 305]</span><a name='Page_305' id=
"Page_305"></a>
<p>When making custard filling for Layer Cake always set the dish
containing the custard in another dish of boiling water over the
fire; this prevents its burning, which would destroy its
flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LAYER JELLY CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Almost any soft cake recipe can be used for jelly cake. The
following is excellent: One cup of sugar, half a cup of butter,
three eggs, half a cup of sweet milk, two cups of flour, two
heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder, flavoring.</p>
<p>For white, delicate cake the rule for "Silver Cake" is fine;
care should be taken, however, that the oven is just right for this
cake, as it browns very easily. To be baked in jelly-cake tins in
layers, with filling put between when done.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUSTARD OR CREAM CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Cream together two cups of sugar and half a cup of butter; add
half a cup of sweet milk in which is dissolved half a teaspoonful
of soda. Beat the whites of six eggs to a stiff froth and add to
the mixture. Have one heaping teaspoonful of cream of tartar
stirred thoroughly into three cups of sifted flour and add quickly.
Bake in a moderate oven in layers like jelly cake, and, when done,
spread custard between.</p>
<p><i>For the Custard.</i>&mdash;Take two cups of sweet milk, put
it into a clean suitable dish, set it in a dish of <i>boiling</i>
water on the range or stove. When the milk comes to a boil add two
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch or flour stirred into half a cup of
sugar, adding the yolks of four eggs and a little cold milk. Stir
this into the boiling milk and when cooked thick enough set aside
to cool; afterwards add the flavoring, either vanilla or lemon. It
is best to make the custard first, before making the cake part.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HICKORY NUT OR WALNUT CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of fine white sugar creamed with half a cup of butter,
three eggs, two-thirds of a cup of sweet milk, three cups of sifted
flour, one heaping teaspoonful of baking powder sifted through the
flour; a tablespoonful (level) of powdered mace, a coffeecup of
hickory nut or walnut meats chopped a little. Fill the cake-pans
with a layer of the cake, then a layer of raisins upon that, then
strew over <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 306]</span><a name='Page_306'
id="Page_306"></a>these a handful of nuts, and so on until the pan
is two-thirds full. Line the tins with well-buttered paper and bake
in a steady, but not quick, oven. This is most excellent.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHEAP CREAM CAKE.</b></p>
<p>One cup of sugar, one egg, one cup sweet milk, two cups flour,
one tablespoonful butter, two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking
powder; flavor to taste. Divide into three parts and bake in round
shallow pans.</p>
<p><i>Cream.</i>&mdash;Beat one egg and one-half cup sugar
together, then add one-quarter cup flour, wet with a very little
milk and stir this mixture into one-half pint of boiling milk,
until thick; flavor to taste. Spread the cream when cool between
the cakes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOFT GINGER CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Stir to a cream one cupful of butter and half a cupful of brown
sugar; add to this two cupfuls of cooking molasses, a cupful of
sweet milk, a tablespoonful of ginger, a teaspoonful of ground
cinnamon; beat all thoroughly together, then add three eggs, the
whites and yolks beaten separately; beat into this two cups of
sifted flour, then a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a spoonful of
water and last, two more cupfuls of sifted flour. Butter and paper
two common square bread-pans, divide the mixture and pour half into
each. Bake in a moderate oven. This cake requires long and slow
baking, from forty to sixty minutes. I find that if sour milk is
used the cakes are much lighter, but either sweet or sour is most
excellent.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HARD GINGERBREAD.</b></p>
<p>Made the same as "Soft Gingerbread," omitting the eggs and
mixing hard enough to roll out like biscuit; rolled nearly half an
inch thick and cut out like small biscuits, or it can be baked in a
sheet or on a biscuit-tin; cut slits a quarter of an inch deep
across the top of the tin from side to side. When baked and while
hot, rub over the top with molasses and let it dry on.</p>
<p>These two recipes are the best I have ever found among a large
variety that I have tried, the ingredients giving the best
proportion for flavor and excellence.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 307]</span><a name='Page_307' id=
"Page_307"></a>
<p><b>PLAIN GINGERBREAD.</b></p>
<p>One cup of <i>dark</i> cooking molasses, one cup of sour cream,
one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little warm water, a
teaspoonful of salt and one heaping teaspoonful of ginger; make
about as thick as cup cake. To be eaten warm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHITE GINGER BISCUIT.</b></p>
<p>One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, one cup of sour cream or
milk, three eggs, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a
tablespoonful of warm water, one tablespoonful of ginger, one
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon and five cups of sifted flour, or
enough to roll out <i>soft</i>. Cut out rather thick like biscuits;
brush over the tops, while hot, with the white of an egg, or
sprinkle with sugar while hot.</p>
<p>The grated rind and the juice of an orange add much to the
flavor of ginger cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOLD AND SILVER CAKE.</b></p>
<p>This cake is baked in layers like jelly cake. Divide the silver
cake batter and color it pink with a little cochineal; this gives
you pink, white and yellow layers. Put together with frosting.
Frost the top.</p>
<p>This can be put together like marble cake, first a spoonful of
one kind, then another, until the dish is full.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOSTON CREAM CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Put into a large-sized saucepan half a cup of butter and one cup
of hot water; set it on the fire; when the mixture begins to boil,
turn in a pint of sifted flour at once, beat and work it well with
a vegetable masher until it is very smooth. Remove from the fire,
and when cool enough add five eggs that have been well beaten,
first the yolks and then the whites, also half a teaspoonful of
soda and a teaspoonful of salt. Drop on buttered tins in large
spoonfuls about two inches apart. Bake in a quick oven about
fifteen minutes. When done and quite cold, open them on the side
with a knife or scissors and put in as much of the custard as
possible.</p>
<p><i>Cream for Filling.</i>&mdash;Made of two eggs, three
tablespoonfuls of sifted flour (or half cup of cornstarch) and one
cup of sugar. Put two-thirds of a pint of milk over the fire in a
double boiler; in a third of a pint of milk, stir the sugar, flour
and beaten eggs. As soon as the milk looks like boiling, pour in
the mixture and stir briskly for <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
308]</span><a name='Page_308' id="Page_308"></a>three minutes,
until it thickens; then remove from the fire and add a teaspoonful
of butter; when cool, flavor with vanilla or lemon and fill your
cakes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS.</b></p>
<p>Make the mixture exactly like the recipe for "Boston Cream
Cakes." Spread it on buttered pans in oblong pieces about four
inches long and one and a half wide, to be laid about two inches
apart; they must be baked in a rather quick oven about twenty-five
minutes. As soon as baked ice with chocolate icing, and when this
is cold split them on one side and fill with the same cream as
"Boston Cream Cakes."</p>
<br>
<p><b>HUCKLEBERRY CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Beat a cup of butter and two cups of sugar together until light,
then add a half cup of milk, four eggs beaten separately, the yolks
to a cream and the whites to a stiff froth, one teaspoonful of
grated nutmeg, the same of cinnamon and two teaspoonfuls of baking
powder. The baking powder to be rubbed into the flour. Bub one
quart of huckleberries well with some flour and add them last, but
do not mash them. Pour into buttered pans, about an inch thick;
dust the tops with sugar and bake. It is better the day after
baking.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWEET STRAWBERRY CAKE.</b></p>
<p>Three eggs, one cupful of sugar, two of flour, one tablespoonful
of butter, a teaspoonful, heaped, of baking powder. Beat the butter
and sugar together and add the eggs well beaten. Stir in the flour
and baking powder well sifted together. Bake in deep tin plate.
This quantity will fill four plates. With three pints of
strawberries mix a cupful of sugar and mash them a little. Spread
the fruit between the layers of cake. The top layer of strawberries
may be covered with a meringue made with the white of an egg and a
tablespoonful of powdered sugar.</p>
<p>Save out the largest berries and arrange them around in circles
on the top in the white frosting. Makes a very fancy dish, as well
as a most delicious cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOLASSES CUP CAKES.</b></p>
<p>One cup of butter, one of sugar, six eggs, five cupfuls of
sifted flour, one tablespoonful of cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls of
ginger, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 309]</span><a name='Page_309' id=
"Page_309"></a>three teacupfuls of cooking molasses and one heaping
teaspoonful of soda. Stir the butter and sugar to a cream; beat the
eggs very light, the yolks and whites separately, and add to it;
after which put in the spices; then the molasses and flour in
rotation, stirring the mixture all the time; beat the whole
<i>well</i> before adding the soda and but little afterwards. Put
into well-buttered patty-pan tins and bake in a <i>very
moderate</i> oven. A baker's recipe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKERS' GINGER SNAPS.</b></p>
<p>Boil all together the following ingredients: Two cups of brown
sugar, two cups of cooking molasses, one cup of shortening, which
should be part butter, one <i>large</i> tablespoonful of ginger,
one tablespoonful of ground cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves;
remove from the fire and let it cool. In the meantime, sift four
cups of flour and stir part of it into the above mixture. Now
dissolve a teaspoonful of soda in a tablespoonful of warm water and
beat into this mixture, stir in the remainder of the flour and make
stiff enough to roll into long rolls about an inch in diameter, and
cut off from the end into half-inch pieces. Place them on
well-buttered tins, giving plenty of room to spread. Bake in a
moderate oven. Let them cool before taking out of the tins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GINGER COOKIES.</b></p>
<p>One cup sugar, one cup molasses, one cup butter, one egg, one
tablespoonful vinegar, one tablespoonful ginger, one teaspoonful
soda dissolved in boiling water, mix like cooky dough, rather
soft.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GINGER SNAPS.</b></p>
<p>One cup brown sugar, two cups molasses, one large cup butter,
two teaspoonfuls soda, two teaspoonfuls ginger, three pints flour
to commence with; rub shortening and sugar together into the flour;
add enough more flour to roll very smooth, very thin, and bake in a
quick oven. The dough can be kept for days by putting it in the
flour barrel under the flour, and bake a few at a time The more
flour that can be worked in and the smoother they can be rolled,
the better and more brittle they will be. Should be rolled out to
wafer-like thinness. Bake quickly without burning. They should
become perfectly cold before putting aside.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 310]</span><a name='Page_310' id=

<p><b>DOMINOES.</b></p>
<p>Have a plain cake baked in rather thin sheets and cut into small
oblong pieces the size and shape of a domino, a trifle larger.
Frost the top and sides. When the frosting is hard, draw the black
lines and make the dots with a small brush dipped in melted
chocolate. These are very nice for children's parties.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FANCY CAKES.</b></p>
<p>These delicious little fancy cakes may be made by making a rich
jumble-paste&mdash;rolling out in any desired shape; cut some paste
in thick, narrow strips and lay around your cakes, so as to form a
deep, cup-like edge; place on a well-buttered tin and bake. When
done, fill with iced fruit prepared as follows: Take rich, ripe
peaches (canned ones will do if fine and well drained from all
juice) cut in halves; plums, strawberries, pineapples cut in
squares or small triangles, or any other available fruit, and dip
in the white of an egg that has been very slightly beaten and then
in pulverized sugar, and lay in the centre of your cakes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WAFERS.</b></p>
<p>Dissolve four ounces of butter in half a teacup of milk; stir
together four ounces of white sugar, eight ounces of sifted flour
and the yolk of one egg, adding gradually the butter and milk, a
tablespoonful of orange-flour water and a pinch of salt; mix it
well. Heat the wafer-irons, butter their inner surfaces, put in a
tablespoonful of the batter and close the irons immediately; put
the irons over the fire, and turn them occasionally, until the
wafer is cooked; when the wafers are all cooked roll them on a
small round stick, stand them upon a sieve and dry them; serve with
ices.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Take the yolks and whites of five eggs and beat them separately
(the whites to a stiff froth.) Then mix the beaten yolks with half
a pound of pulverized and sifted loaf or crushed sugar, and beat
the two together thoroughly. Fifteen minutes will be none too long
for the latter operation if you would have excellence with your
cakes.</p>
<p>Now add half a pound of fine flour, dredging it in a little at a
time, and then put in the whites of the eggs, beating the whole
together for <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 311]</span><a name=
'Page_311' id="Page_311"></a>four or five minutes. Then with a
large spoon, drop the batter upon a baking tin, which has been
buttered and floured, being careful to have the cakes as nearly the
same size as possible and resembling in shape the half of a peach.
Have a quick oven ready and bake the cakes about ten minutes,
watching them closely so that they may only come to a light brown
color. Then take them out, spread the flat side of each with peach
jam, and stick them together in pairs, covering the outside with a
thin coat of icing, which when dry can be brushed over on one side
of the cake, with a little cochineal water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUP CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of milk, three
cups and a half of flour and four eggs, half a teaspoonful of soda,
large spoon cream of tartar; stir butter and sugar together and add
the beaten yolks of the eggs, then the milk, then flavoring and the
whites. Put cream of tartar in flour and add last. Bake in buttered
gem-pans, or drop the batter, a teaspoonful at a time, in rows on
flat buttered tins.</p>
<p>To this recipe may be added a cup of English currants or chopped
raisins; and also another variety of cake may be made by adding a
half cup citron sliced and floured, a half cupful of chopped
almonds and lemon extract.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VARIEGATED CAKES.</b></p>
<p>One cup powdered sugar, one-half cup of butter creamed with the
sugar, one-half cup of milk, four eggs, the whites only, whipped
light, two and one-half cups prepared flour. Bitter almond
flavoring, spinach juice and cochineal. Cream the butter and sugar;
add the milk, flavoring, the whites and flour. Divide the batter
into three parts. Bruise and pound a few leaves of spinach in a
thin muslin bag until you can express the juice. Put a few drops of
this into one portion of the batter, color another with cochineal,
leaving the third white. Put a little of each into small, round
pans or cups, giving a light stir to each color as you add the
next. This will vein the cakes prettily. Put the white between the
pink and green, that the tints may show better. If you can get
pistachio nuts to pound up for the green, the cakes will be much
nicer. Ice on sides and top.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 312]</span><a name='Page_312' id=

<p><b>CORNSTARCH CAKES.</b></p>
<p>One cupful each of butter and sweet milk and half a cup of
cornstarch, two cupfuls each of sugar and flour, the whites of five
eggs beaten to a stiff froth, two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar
and one of soda; flavor to taste. Bake in gem-tins or
patty-pans.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPONGE DROPS.</b></p>
<p>Beat to a froth three eggs and one teacup of sugar; stir into
this one heaping coffeecup of flour, in which one teaspoonful of
cream of tartar and half a teaspoonful of saleratus are thoroughly
mixed. Flavor with lemon. Butter tin sheets with washed butter and
drop in teaspoonfuls about three inches apart. Bake instantly in a
very quick oven. Watch closely as they will burn easily. Serve with
ice cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SAVORY BISCUITS OR LADY FINGERS.</b></p>
<p>Put nine tablespoonfuls of fine white sugar into a bowl and put
the bowl into hot water to heat the sugar; when the sugar is
thoroughly heated, break nine eggs into the bowl and beat them
quickly until they become a little warm and rather thick; then take
the bowl from the water and continue beating until it is nearly or
quite cold; now stir in lightly nine tablespoonfuls of sifted
flour; then with a paper funnel, or something of the kind, lay this
mixture out upon papers, in biscuits three inches long and half an
inch thick, in the form of fingers; sift sugar over the biscuits
and bake them upon tins to a light brown; when they are done and
cold, remove them from the papers, by wetting them on the back; dry
them and they are ready for use. They are often used in making
Charlotte Russe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PASTRY SANDWICHES.</b></p>
<p>Puff paste, jam of any kind, the white of an egg, sifted
sugar.</p>
<p>Roll the paste out thin; put half of it on a baking sheet or
tin, and spread equally over it apricot, greengage, or any preserve
that may be preferred. Lay over this preserve another thin paste,
press the edges together all round, and mark the paste in lines
with a knife on the surface, to show where to cut it when baked.
Bake from twenty minutes to half an hour; and, a short time before
being done, take the pastry out of the oven, brush it over with the
white of an egg, sift over <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
313]</span><a name='Page_313' id="Page_313"></a>pounded sugar and
put it back in the oven to color. When cold, cut it into strips;
pile these on a dish pyramidically and serve.</p>
<p>This may be made of jelly-cake dough, and, after baking, allowed
to cool before spreading with the preserve; either way is good, as
well as fanciful.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NEAPOLITAINES.</b></p>
<p>One cup of powdered sugar, half a cup of butter, two
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, three whole eggs and three yolks,
beaten separately, three cups of sifted flour. Put this all
together with half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a
tablespoonful of milk. If it is too stiff to roll out, add just
enough more milk. Roll it a quarter of an inch thick and cut it out
with any tin cutter. Place the cakes in a pan slightly greased and
color the tops with beaten egg and milk, with some chopped almonds
over them. Bake in a rather quick oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BRUNSWICK JELLY CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Stir one cup of powdered white sugar and one-half cup of butter
together, till perfectly light; beat the yolks of three eggs till
very thick and smooth; sift three cups of flour and stir it into
the beaten eggs with the butter and sugar; add a teaspoonful of
mixed spice (nutmeg, mace and cinnamon) and half a glass of
rose-water or wine; stir the whole well and lay it on your
paste-board, which must first be sprinkled with flour; if you find
it so moist as to be unmanageable, throw in a little more flour;
spread the dough into a sheet about half an inch thick and cut it
out in round cakes with a biscuit-cutter; lay them in buttered pans
and bake about five or six minutes; when cold, spread over the
surface of each cake a liquor of fruit jelly or marmalade; then
beat the whites of three or four eggs till they stand alone; beat
into the froth, by degrees, a sufficiency of powdered loaf sugar to
make it as thick as icing; flavor with a few drops of strong
essence of lemon, and with a spoon heap it up on each cake, making
it high in the centre; put the cakes into a cool oven, and as soon
as the tops are colored a pale brown, take them out.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LITTLE PLUM CAKES.</b></p>
<p>One cup of sugar and half a cup of butter beaten to a smooth
cream; add three well-beaten eggs, a teaspoonful of vanilla
extract, four cups of sifted flour, one cup of raisins and one of
currants, half <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 314]</span><a name=
'Page_314' id="Page_314"></a>of a teaspoonful of baking soda
dissolved in a little water, and milk enough to make a stiff
batter; drop this batter in drops on well-buttered tins and bake in
a <i>quick</i> oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JUMBLES.</b></p>
<p>Cream together two cups of sugar and one of butter, add three
well-beaten eggs and six tablespoonfuls of sweet milk, two
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, flavor to taste, flour enough to
make into a soft dough; do not roll it on the paste-board, but
break off pieces of dough the size of a walnut and make into rings
by rolling out rolls as large as your finger, and joining the ends;
lay them on tins to bake, an inch apart, as it rises and spreads;
bake in a <i>moderate</i> oven. These jumbles are very delicate and
will keep a long time.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WINE JUMBLES.</b></p>
<p>One cup of butter, two of sugar, three eggs, one wine-glass of
wine, one spoonful of vanilla and flour enough to roll out. Roll as
thin as the blade of a knife and cut with an oval cutter. Bake on
tin-sheets in a quick oven until a dark brown. These will keep a
year if kept in a tin box and in a dry place.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT JUMBLES.</b></p>
<p>Grate one large cupful of cocoanut; rub one cupful of butter
with one and a half cupfuls of sugar; add three beaten eggs, whites
and yolks separately, two tablespoonfuls of milk and five cupfuls
of sifted flour; then add by degrees the grated nut, so as to make
a stiff dough, rolled thin and cut with a round cutter, having a
hole in the middle. Bake in a quick oven from five to ten
minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PHILADELPHIA JUMBLES.</b></p>
<p>Two cups of sugar, one cup of butter, eight eggs beaten light;
essence of bitter almond or rose to taste; enough flour to enable
you to roll them out.</p>
<p>Stir the sugar and butter to a light cream, then add the
well-whipped eggs, the flavoring and flour; mix well together, roll
out in powdered sugar in a sheet a quarter of an inch thick; cut
into rings with a jagging-iron and bake in a quick oven on buttered

<br>
<p><b>DOUGHNUTS OR FRIED CAKES.</b></p>
<p>Success in making good fried cakes depends as much on the
<i>cooking</i> as the mixing. In the first place, there should be
boiling lard enough to free them from the bottom of the kettle, so
that they swim on the top, and the lard should never be so hot as
to smoke or so cool as not to be at the boiling point; if it is,
they soak grease and are spoiled. If it is at the right heat, the
doughnuts will in about ten minutes be of a delicate brown outside
and nicely cooked inside. Five or six minutes will cook a cruller.
Try the fat by dropping a bit of the dough in first; if it is
right, the fat will boil up when it is dropped in. They should be
turned over almost constantly, which causes them to rise and brown
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 317]</span><a name='Page_317' id=
"Page_317"></a>evenly. When they are sufficiently cooked, raise
them from the hot fat and drain them until every drop ceases
dripping.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRULLERS OR FRIED CAKES.</b></p>
<p>One and a half cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of sour milk, two
eggs, two scant tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a nutmeg
grated, a large teaspoonful of cinnamon, a teaspoonful of salt and
one of soda; make a little stiffer than biscuit dough, roll out a
quarter of an inch thick, and cut with a fried-cake cutter, with a
hole in the centre. Fry in hot lard.</p>
<p>These can be made with sweet milk and baking powder, using two
heaping teaspoonfuls of the baking powder in place of soda.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RAISED DOUGHNUTS.</b></p>
<p>Old-fashioned "raised doughnuts" are seldom seen nowadays, but
are easily made. Make a sponge as for bread, using a pint of warm
water or milk, and a large half cupful of yeast; when the sponge is
very light, add half a cupful of butter or sweet lard, a
coffeecupful of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt and one small
teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little water, one tablespoonful
of cinnamon, a little grated nutmeg; stir in now two well-beaten
eggs, add sifted flour until it is the consistency of biscuit
dough, knead it well, cover and let rise; then roll the dough out
into a sheet half an inch thick, cut out with a very small
biscuit-cutter, or in strips half an inch wide and three inches
long, place them on greased tins, cover them well and let them rise
before frying them. Drop them in very hot lard. Raised cakes
require longer time than cakes made with baking powder. Sift
powdered sugar over them as fast as they are fried, while warm. Our
grandmothers put allspice into these cakes; that, however, is a
matter of taste.</p>

<h2><b>PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>GENERAL REMARKS.</b></p>
<p>Use the very best materials in making pastry; the shortening
should be fresh, sweet and hard; the water cold (ice-water is
best), the paste rolled on a cold board and all handled as little
as possible. When the crust is made, it makes it much more flaky
and puff much more to put it in a dish covered with a cloth and set
in a very cold place for half an hour, or even an hour; in summer,
it could be placed in the ice box.</p>
<p>A great improvement is made in pie crust by the addition of
about a heaping teaspoonful of baking powder to a quart of flour,
also brushing the paste as often as rolled out, and the pieces of
butter placed thereon, with the white of an egg, assists it to rise
in <i>leaves</i> or <i>flakes</i>. As this is the great beauty of
puff paste, it is as well to try this method.</p>
<p>If currants are to be used in pies, they should be carefully
picked over and washed in several waters, dried in a towel and
dredged with flour before they are suitable for use.</p>
<p>Raisins, and all dried fruits for pies and cakes, should be
seeded stoned and dredged with flour before using.</p>
<p>Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water upon them
and then slipping the skin off with the fingers. In pounding them,
always add a little rose or orange-water, with fine sugar, to
prevent their becoming oily.</p>
<p>Great care is requisite in heating an oven for baking pastry. If
you can hold your hand in the heated oven while you count twenty,
the oven has just the proper temperature and it should be kept at
this temperature as long as the pastry is in; this heat will bake
to a light brown and will give the pastry a fresh and flaky
appearance. If you suffer the heat to abate, the under crust will
become heavy and clammy and the upper crust will fall in.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 321]</span><a name='Page_321' id=
"Page_321"></a>
<p>Another good way to ascertain when the oven is heated to the
proper degree for puff paste: put a small piece of the paste in
previous to baking the whole, and then the heat can thus be judged
of.</p>
<p>Pie crust can be kept a week, and the last be better than the if
put in a tightly covered dish and set in the ice chest in summer
and in a cool place in winter, and thus you can make a fresh pie
every day with little trouble.</p>
<p>In baking custard, pumpkin or squash pies, it is well, in order
that the mixture may not be absorbed by the paste, to first partly
bake the paste before adding it, and when stewed fruit is used the
filling should be perfectly cool when put in, or it will make the
bottom crust sodden.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO MAKE A PIE.</b></p>
<p>After making the crust, take a portion of it, roll it out and
fit it to a buttered pie-plate by cutting it off evenly around the
edge; gather up the scraps left from cutting and make into another
sheet for the top crust; roll it a little thinner than the under
crust; lap one-half over the other and cut three or four slits
about a quarter of an inch from the folded edge (this prevents the
steam from escaping through the rim of the pie, and causing the
juices to run out from the edges). Now fill your pie-plate with
your prepared filling, wet the top edge of the rim, lay the upper
crust across the centre of the pie, turn back the half that is
lapped over, seal the two edges together by slightly pressing down
with your thumb, then notch evenly and regularly with a three-tined
fork, dipping occasionally in flour to prevent sticking. Bake in a
rather quick oven a light brown, and until the filling boils up
through the slits in the upper crust.</p>
<p>To prevent the juice soaking through into the crust, making it
soggy wet the under crust with the white of an egg, just before you
put in the pie mixture. If the top of the pie is brushed over with
the egg, it gives it a beautiful glaze.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FOR ICING PASTRY.</b></p>
<p>To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for fruit tarts
and sweet dishes of pastry, put the white of an egg on a plate and
with the blade of a knife beat it to a stiff froth. When the pastry
is nearly baked, brush it over with this and sift over some pounded
sugar; put it back into the oven to set the glaze and in a few
minutes <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 322]</span><a name='Page_322' id=
"Page_322"></a>it will be done. Great care should be taken that the
paste does not catch or burn in the oven, which is very liable to
do after the icing is laid on.</p>
<p>Or make a meringue by adding a tablespoonful of white sugar to
the beaten white of one egg. Spread over the top and slightly brown
in the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FINE PUFF PASTE.</b></p>
<p>Into one quart of sifted flour mix two teaspoonfuls of baking
powder and a teaspoonful of salt; <i>then sift again</i>. Measure
out one teacupful of butter and one of lard, hard and cold. Take
the lard and rub into the flour until a very fine smooth paste.
Then put in just enough <i>ice-water</i>, say half a cupful,
containing a beaten white of egg, to mix a very stiff dough. Boll
it out into a thin sheet, spread with one-fourth of the butter,
sprinkle over with a little flour, then roll up closely in a long
roll, like a scroll, double the ends towards the centre, flatten
and re-roll, then spread again with another quarter of the butter.
Repeat this operation until the butter is used up. Put it on an
earthen dish, cover it with a cloth and set it in a cold place, in
the ice box in summer; let it remain until <i>cold</i>; an hour or
more before making out the crust. Tarts made with this paste cannot
be cut with a knife when fresh; they go into flakes at the
touch.</p>
<p>You may roll this pastry in any direction, from you, toward you,
sideways, any way, it matters not, but you must have nice flour,
<i>ice-water</i> and very <i>little</i> of it, and strength to roll
it, if you would succeed.</p>
<p>This recipe I purchased from a colored cook on one of the Lake
Michigan steamers many years ago, and it is, without exception, the
finest puff paste I have ever seen.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PUFF PASTE FOR PIES.</b></p>
<p>One quart of pastry flour, one pint of butter, one tablespoonful
of salt, one of sugar, one and a quarter cupfuls of ice-water. Wash
the hands with soap and water and dip them first in very hot and
then in cold water. Rinse a large bowl or pan with boiling water
and then with cold. Half fill it with cold water. Wash the butter
in this, working it with the hands until it is light and waxy. This
frees it from the salt and buttermilk and lightens it, so that the
pastry is more delicate. Shape the butter into two thin cakes and
put in a pan of ice-water to harden. Mix the salt and sugar with
the flour. With the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 323]</span><a name=
'Page_323' id="Page_323"></a>hands, rub one-third of the butter
into the flour. Add the water, stirring with a knife. Stir quickly
and vigorously until the paste is a smooth ball. Sprinkle the board
<i>lightly</i> with flour. Turn the paste on this and pound quickly
and lightly with the rolling-pin. Do not break the paste. Roll from
you and to one side; or if easier to roll from you all the time,
turn the paste around. When it is about one-fourth of an inch
thick, wipe the remaining butter, break it in bits and spread these
on the paste. Sprinkle lightly with flour. Fold the paste,
one-third from each side, so that the edges meet. Now fold from the
ends, but do not have these meet. Double the paste, pound lightly
and roll down to about one-third of an inch in thickness. Fold as
before and roll down again. Repeat this three times if for pies and
six times if for <i>vol-au-vents</i>, patties, tarts, etc. Place on
the ice to harden, when it has been rolled the last time. It should
be in the ice chest at least an hour before being used. In hot
weather, if the paste sticks when being rolled down, put it on a
tin sheet and place on ice. As soon as it is chilled, it will roll
easily. The less flour you use in rolling out the paste, the
tenderer it will be. No matter how carefully every part of the work
may be done, the paste will not be good if much flour is used.</p>

<br>
<p><b>SOYER'S RECIPE FOR PUFF PASTE.</b></p>
<p>To every pound of flour allow the yolk of one egg, the juice of
one lemon, half a saltspoonful of salt, cold water, one pound of
fresh butter.</p>
<p>Put the flour onto the paste-board; make a hole in the centre,
into which put the yolk of the egg, the lemon juice and salt; mix
the whole with cold water (this should be iced in summer if
convenient) into a soft, flexible paste with the right hand, and
handle it as little as possible; then squeeze all the buttermilk
from the butter, wring it in a cloth and roll out the paste; place
the butter on this and fold the edges of the paste over, so as to
hide it; roll it out again to the thickness of a quarter of an
inch; fold over one-third, over which again pass the rolling-pin;
then fold over the other third, thus forming a square; place it
with the ends, top and bottom before you, shaking a little flour
both under and over, and repeat the rolls and turns twice again as
before. Flour a baking-sheet, put the paste on this and let it
remain on ice or in some cool place for half an hour; then roll
twice more, turning it as before; place it again upon the ice for a
quarter <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 324]</span><a name='Page_324' id=
"Page_324"></a>of an hour, give it two more rolls, making seven in
all, and it is ready for use when required.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RULE FOR UNDER CRUST.</b></p>
<p>A good rule for pie crust for a pie requiring only an under
crust, as a custard or pumpkin pie, is: Three <i>large</i>
tablespoonfuls of flour sifted, rubbing into it a <i>large</i>
tablespoonful of cold butter, or part butter and part lard, and a
pinch of salt, mixing with <i>cold</i> water enough to form a
smooth, stiff paste, and rolled quite thin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN PIE CRUST.</b></p>
<p>Two and a half cupfuls of sifted flour, one cupful of
shortening, half butter and half lard cold, a pinch of salt, a
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder sifted through the flour. Rub
thoroughly the shortening into the flour. Mix together with half a
teacupful of <i>cold</i> water, or enough to form a rather stiff
dough; mix as little as possible, just enough to get it into shape
to roll out; it must be handled very lightly. This rule is for two
pies.</p>
<p>When you have a little pie crust left do not throw it away; roll
it thin, cut in small squares and bake. Just before tea put a
spoonful of raspberry jelly on each square.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PUFF PASTE OF SUET.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one
teaspoonful of baking powder, one cup of chopped suet, freed of
skin, and chopped very fine, one cupful of water. Place the flour,
sifted with the powder in a bowl, add suet and water; mix into
smooth, rather firm dough.</p>
<p>This paste is excellent for fruit puddings and dumplings that
are boiled; if it is well made, it will be light and flaky and the
suet impreceptible. It is also excellent for meat pies, baked or
boiled. All the ingredients should be very cold when mixing, and
the suet dredged with flour after it is chopped, to prevent the
particles from adhering to each other.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POTATO CRUST.</b></p>
<p>Boil and mash a dozen medium-sized potatoes, add one good
teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of cold butter and half a
cupful of milk or cream. Stiffen with flour sufficient to roll out.
Nice for the tops of meat pies.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 325]</span><a name='Page_325' id=
"Page_325"></a>
<p><b>TO MAKE PIE CRUST FLAKY.</b></p>
<p>In making a pie, after you have rolled out your top crust, cut
it about the right size, spread it over with butter, then shake
sifted flour over the butter, enough to cover it well. Cut a slit
in the middle place it over the top of your pie, and fasten the
edges as any pie. Now take the pie on your left hand and a dipper
of cold water in your right hand; tip the pie slanting a little,
pour over the water sufficiently to rinse off the flour. Enough
flour will stick to the butter to fry into the crust, to give it a
fine, blistered, flaky look, which many cooks think is much better
than rolling the butter into the crust.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TARTLETS. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Tarts of strawberry or any other kind of preserves are generally
made of the trimmings of puff paste rolled a little thicker than
the ordinary pies; then cut out with a round cutter, first dipped
in hot water, to make the edges smooth, and placed in small
tart-pans, first pricking a few holes at the bottom with a fork
before placing them in the oven. Bake from ten to fifteen minutes.
Let the paste cool a little; then fill it with preserve. By this
manner, both the flavor and color of the jam are preserved, which
would be lost were it baked in the oven on the paste; and, besides,
so much jam is not required.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TARTLETS. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Tartlets are nice made in this manner: Roll some good puff paste
out thin, and cut it into two and a half inch squares; brush each
square over with the white of an egg, then fold down the corners,
so that they all meet in the middle of each piece of paste;
slightly press the two pieces together, brush them over with the
egg, sift over sugar and bake in a nice quick oven for about a
quarter of an hour. When they are done, make a little hole in the
middle of the paste and fill it up with apricot jam, marmalade, or
red currant jelly. Pile them high in the centre of a dish on a
napkin and garnish with the same preserves the tartlets are filled
with.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PATTIES, OR SHELLS FOR TARTS.</b></p>
<p>Roll out a nice puff paste thin; cut out with a glass or
cookie-cutter and with a wine-glass or smaller cutter, cut out the
centre of two out of three; lay the rings thus made on the third,
and bake at once. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 326]</span><a name=
'Page_326' id="Page_326"></a>May be used for veal or oyster
patties, or filled with jelly, jam or preserves, as tarts. Or
shells may be made by lining patty-pans with paste. If the paste is
light, the shells will be fine. Filled with jelly and covered with
meringue (tablespoonful of sugar to the white of one egg) and
browned in oven, they are very nice to serve for tea.</p>
<p>If the cutters are dipped in <i>hot water</i>, the edges of the
tartlets will rise much higher and smoother when baking.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TARTS.</b></p>
<p>Larger pans are required for tarts proper, the size of small,
shallow pie-tins; then after the paste is baked and cooled and
filled with the jam or preserve, a few stars or leaves are placed
on the top, or strips of paste, criss-crossed on the top, all of
which have been previously baked on a tin by themselves.</p>
<p>Dried fruit, stewed until thick, makes fine tart pies, also
cranberries stewed and well sweetened.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN APPLE PIE.</b></p>
<p>Peel, core and slice tart apples enough for a pie; sprinkle over
about three tablespoonfuls of sugar, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, a
small level tablespoonful of sifted flour, two tablespoonfuls of
water, a few bits of butter, stir all together with a spoon; put it
into a pie-tin lined with pie paste; cover with a top crust and
bake about forty minutes.</p>
<p>The result will be a delicious, juicy pie.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE CUSTARD PIE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Three cupfuls of milk, four eggs and one cupful of sugar, two
cupfuls of thick stewed apples, strained through a colander. Beat
the whites and yolks of the eggs lightly and mix the yolks well
with the apples, flavoring with nutmeg. Then beat into this the
milk and, lastly, the whites. Let the crust partly bake before
turning in this filling. To be baked with only the one crust, like
all custard pies.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE CUSTARD PIE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Select fair sweet apples, pare and grate them, and to every
teacupful of the apple add two eggs well beaten, two tablespoonfuls
of fine sugar, one of melted butter, the grated rind and half the
juice of one lemon, half a wine-glass of brandy and one teacupful
of milk; <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 327]</span><a name='Page_327'
id="Page_327"></a>mix all well and pour into a deep plate lined
with paste; put a strip of the paste around the edge of the dish
and bake thirty minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE CUSTARD PIE. No. 3.</b></p>
<p>Lay a crust in your plates; slice apples thin and half fill your
plates; pour over them a custard made of four eggs and one quart of
milk, sweetened and seasoned to your taste.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE CUSTARD PIE. No. 4.</b></p>
<p>Peel sour apples and stew until soft, and not much water left in
them; then rub through a colander; beat three eggs for each pie to
be baked and put in at the rate of one cupful of butter and one of
sugar for three pies; season with nutmeg.</p>
<br>
<p><b>IRISH APPLE PIE.</b></p>
<p>Pare and take out the cores of the apples, cutting each apple
into four or eight pieces, according to their size. Lay them neatly
in a baking dish, seasoning them with brown sugar and any spice,
such as pounded cloves and cinnamon, or grated lemon peel. A little
quince marmalade gives a fine flavor to the pie. Add a little water
and cover with puff paste. Bake for an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOCK APPLE PIE.</b></p>
<p>Crush finely with a rolling pin, one large Boston cracker; put
it into a bowl and pour upon it one teacupful of cold water; add
one teacupful of fine white sugar, the juice and pulp of one lemon,
half a lemon rind grated and a little nutmeg; line the pie-plate
with half puff paste, pour in the mixture, cover with the paste and
bake half an hour.</p>
<p>These are proportions for one pie.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE AND PEACH MERINGUE PIE.</b></p>
<p>Stew the apples or peaches and sweeten to taste. Mash smooth and
season with nutmeg. Fill the crusts and bake until just done. Put
on no top crust. Take the whites of three eggs for each pie and
whip to a stiff froth, and sweeten with three tablespoonfuls of
powdered sugar. Flavor with rose-water or vanilla; beat until it
will stand alone; then spread it on the pie one-half to one inch
thick; set it back into the oven until the meringue is well "set."
Eat cold.</p>

<p><b>COCOANUT PIE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>One-half cup desiccated cocoanut soaked in one cupful of milk,
two eggs, one small cupful of sugar, butter the size of an egg.
This is for one small-sized pie. Nice with a meringue on top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT PIE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Cut off the brown part of the cocoanut, grate the white part,
mix it with milk and set it on the fire and let it boil slowly
eight or ten minutes. To a pound of the grated cocoanut, allow a
quart of milk, eight eggs, four tablespoonfuls of sifted white
sugar, a glass of wine, a small cracker, pounded fine, two
spoonfuls of melted butter and half a nutmeg. The eggs and sugar
should be beaten together to a froth, then the wine stirred in. Put
them into the milk and cocoanut, which should be first allowed to
get quite cool; add the cracker and nutmeg, turn the whole into
deep pie plates, with a lining and rim of puff paste. Bake them as
soon as turned into the plates.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE CUSTARD PIE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>One-quarter cake of Baker's chocolate, grated; one pint of
boiling water, six eggs, one quart of milk, one-half cupful of
white sugar, two teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Dissolve the chocolate in
a very little milk, stir into the boiling water and boil three
minutes. When nearly cold beat up with this the yolks of all the
eggs and the whites of three. Stir this mixture into the milk,
season and pour into shells of good paste. When the custard is
"set"&mdash;but not more than half done&mdash;spread over it the
whites whipped to a froth, with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. You
may bake these custards without paste, in a pudding dish or cups
set in boiling water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE PIE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Put some grated chocolate into a basin and place on the back of
the stove and let it melt (do not add any water to it); beat one
egg and some sugar in it; when melted, spread this on the top of a
custard pie. Lovers of chocolate will like this.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON PIE. No. 1. (Superior.)</b></p>
<p>Take a deep dish, grate into it the outside of the rind of two
lemons; add to that a cup and a half of white sugar, two heaping
tablespoonfuls of unsifted flour, or one of cornstarch; stir it
well <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 329]</span><a name='Page_329' id=
"Page_329"></a>together, then add the yolks of three well-beaten
eggs, beat this thoroughly, then add the juice of the lemons, two
cups of water and a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Set this
on the fire in another dish containing boiling water and cook it
until it thickens, and will dip up on the spoon like cold honey.
Remove from the fire, and when cooled, pour it into a deep pie-tin,
lined with pastry; bake, and when done, have ready the whites,
beaten stiff, with three small tablespoonfuls of sugar. Spread this
over the top and return to the oven, to set and brown slightly.
This makes a deep, large sized pie, and very superior.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Ebbitt House, Washington.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON PIE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>One coffee cupful of sugar, three eggs, one cupful of water, one
tablespoonful of melted butter, one heaping tablespoonful of flour,
the juice and a little of the rind of one lemon. Reserve the whites
of the eggs, and after the pie is baked, spread them over the top
beaten lightly-with a spoonful of sugar, and return to the oven
until it is a light brown.</p>
<p>This may be cooked before it is put into the crust or not, but
it is rather better to cook it first in a double boiler or dish. It
makes a medium-sized pie. Bake from thirty-five to forty
minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON PIE. No. 3.</b></p>
<p>Moisten a heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch with a little cold
water, then add a cupful of boiling water; stir over the fire till
it boils and cook the cornstarch, say two or three minutes; add
teaspoonful of butter and a cupful of sugar; take off the fire and,
when slightly cooled, add an egg well beaten and the juice and
grated rind of a fresh lemon. Bake with a crust. This makes one
small pie.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON PIE. No. 4.</b></p>
<p>Two large, fresh lemons, grate off the rind, if not bitter
reserve it for the filling of the pie, pare off every bit of the
white skin of the lemon (as it toughens while cooking); then cut
the lemon into very thin slices with a sharp knife and take out the
seeds; two cupfuls of sugar, three tablespoonfuls of water and two
of sifted flour. Put into the pie a layer of lemon, then one of
sugar, then one of the grated rind and, lastly, of flour, and so on
till the ingredients are used; sprinkle the water over all, and
cover with upper crust. Be <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
330]</span><a name='Page_330' id="Page_330"></a>sure to have the
under crust lap over the upper, and pinch it well, as the syrup
will cook all out if care is not taken when finishing the edge of
crust. This quantity makes one medium-sized pie.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE PIE.</b></p>
<p>Grate the rind of one and use the juice of two large oranges.
Stir together a large cupful of sugar and a heaping tablespoonful
of flour; add to this the well-beaten yolks of three eggs, two
tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Reserve the whites for frosting.
Turn this into a pie-pan lined with pie paste and bake in a quick
oven. When done so as to resemble a finely baked custard, spread on
the top of it the beaten whites, which must be sweetened with two
tablespoonfuls of sugar; spread evenly and return to the oven and
brown slightly.</p>
<p>The addition of the juice of half a lemon improves it, if
convenient to have it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKERS' CUSTARD PIE.</b></p>
<p>Beat up the yolks of three eggs to a cream. Stir thoroughly a
tablespoonful of sifted flour into three tablespoonfuls of sugar;
this separates the particles of flour so that there will be no
lumps; then add it to the beaten yolks, put in a pinch of salt, a
teaspoonful of vanilla and a little grated nutmeg; next the
well-beaten whites of the eggs; and, lastly, a pint of scalded milk
(not boiled) which has been cooled; mix this in by degrees and turn
all into a deep pie-pan lined with puff paste, and bake from
twenty-five to thirty minutes.</p>
<p>I received this recipe from a celebrated cook in one of our best
New York bakeries. I inquired of him "why it was that their custard
pies had that look of solidity and smoothness that our home-made
pies have not." He replied, "The secret is the addition of this
<i>bit of flour</i>&mdash;not that it thickens the custard any to
speak of, but prevents the custard from breaking or wheying and
gives that smooth appearance when cut."</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM PIE.</b></p>
<p>Pour a pint of cream upon one and a half cupfuls of sugar; let
it stand until the whites of three eggs have been beaten to a stiff
froth; add this to the cream and beat up thoroughly; grate a little
nutmeg over the mixture and bake without an upper crust. If a
tablespoonful of sifted flour is added to it, as the above Custard
Pie recipe, it would improve it.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 331]</span><a name='Page_331' id=
"Page_331"></a>
<p><b>WHIPPED CREAM PIE.</b></p>
<p>Line a pie plate with a rich crust and bake quickly in a hot
oven. When done, spread with a thin layer of jelly or jam, then
whip one cupful of thick sweet cream until it is as light as
possible; sweeten with powdered sugar and flavor with vanilla;
spread over the jelly or jam; set the cream where it will get very
cold before whipping.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUSTARD PIE.</b></p>
<p>Beat together until very light the yolks of four eggs and four
tablespoonfuls of sugar, flavor with nutmeg or vanilla; then add
the four beaten whites, a pinch of salt and, lastly, a quart of
sweet milk; mix well and pour into tins lined with paste. Bake
until firm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOSTON CREAM PIE.</b></p>
<p><i>Cream Part.</i>&mdash;Put on a pint of milk to boil. Break
two eggs into a dish and add one cup of sugar and half a cup of
flour previously mixed after beating well, stir it into the milk
just as the milk commences to boil; add an ounce of butter and keep
on stirring one way until it thickens; flavor with vanilla or
lemon.</p>
<p><i>Crust Part.</i>&mdash;Three eggs beaten separately, one cup
of granulated sugar, one and a half cups of sifted flour, one large
teaspoonful of baking powder and two tablespoonfuls of milk or
water. Divide the batter in half and bake on two medium-sized
pie-tins. Bake in a rather quick oven to a straw color. When done
and cool, split each one in half with a sharp broad-bladed knife,
and spread half the cream between each. Serve cold.</p>
<p>The cake part should be flavored the same as the custard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOCK CREAM PIE.</b></p>
<p>Take three eggs, one pint of milk, a cupful of sugar, two
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch or three of flour; beat the sugar,
cornstarch and yolks of the eggs together; after the milk has come
to a boil, stir in the mixture and add a pinch of salt and about a
teaspoonful of butter. Make crust the same as any pie; bake, then
fill with the custard, grate over a little nutmeg and bake again.
Take the whites of the eggs and beat to a stiff froth with two
tablespoonfuls of sugar, spread over the top and brown in a quick
oven.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT CUSTARD PIE.</b></p>
<p>Any fruit custard, such as pineapple, banana, can be readily
made after the recipe of APPLE CUSTARD PIE.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHERRY PIE.</b></p>
<p>Line your pie plate with good crust, fill half full with ripe
cherries; sprinkle over them about a cupful of sugar, a teaspoonful
of sifted flour, dot a few bits of butter over that. Now fill the
crust full to the top. Cover with the upper crust and bake.</p>
<p>This is one of the best of pies, if made correctly, and the
cherries in any case should be stoned.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRANT PIE.</b></p>
<p>Make in just the same way as the "Cherry Pie," unless they are
somewhat green, then they should be stewed a little.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RIPE CURRANT PIE.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of mashed ripe currants, one of sugar, two
tablespoonfuls of water, one of flour, beaten with the yolks of two
eggs. Bake; frost the top with the beaten whites of the eggs and
two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar and brown in oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN TOMATO PIE.</b></p>
<p>Take medium-sized tomatoes, pare and cut out the stem end.
Having your pie-pan lined with paste made as biscuit dough, slice
the tomatoes <i>very thin</i>, filling the pan somewhat heaping,
then grate over it a nutmeg; put in half a cup of butter and a
medium cup of sugar, if the pan is rather deep. Sprinkle a small
handful of flour over all, pouring in half a cup of vinegar before
adding the top crust. Bake half an hour in a moderately hot oven,
serving hot. Is good; try it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APRICOT MERINGUE PIE.</b></p>
<p>A canned apricot meringue pie is made by cutting the apricots
fine and mixing them with half a cup of sugar and the beaten yolk
of an egg; fill the crust and bake. Take from the oven, let it
stand for two or three minutes, cover with a meringue made of the
beaten white of an egg and one tablespoonful of sugar. Set back in
a slow oven until <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 333]</span><a name=
'Page_333' id="Page_333"></a>it turns a golden brown. The above pie
can be made into a tart without the addition of the meringue by
adding criss-cross strips of pastry when the pie is first put into
the oven.</p>
<p>All of the above are good if made from the dried and stewed
apricots instead of the canned and are much cheaper.</p>
<p>Stewed dried apricots are a delicious addition to mince meat.
They may be used in connection with minced apples, or to the
exclusion of the latter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HUCKLEBERRY PIE.</b></p>
<p>Put a quart of picked huckleberries into a basin of water; take
off, whatever floats; take up the berries by the handful, pick out
all the stems and unripe berries and put them into a dish; line a
buttered pie, dish with a pie paste, put in the berries half an
inch deep, and to a quart of berries, put half of a teacupful of
brown sugar; dredge a teaspoonful of flour over, strew a
saltspoonful of salt and a little nutmeg grated over; cover the
pie, cut a slit in the centre, or make several small incisions on
either side of it; press the two crusts together around the edge,
trim it off neatly with a sharp knife and bake in a quick oven for
three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLACKBERRY PIE.</b></p>
<p>Pick the berries clean, rinse them in cold water and finish as
directed for huckleberries.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOLASSES PIE.</b></p>
<p>Two teacupfuls of molasses; one of sugar, three eggs, one
tablespoonful of melted butter, one lemon, nutmeg; beat and bake in
pastry.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON RAISIN PIE.</b></p>
<p>One cup of chopped raisins, seeded, and the juice and grated
rind of one lemon, one cupful of cold water, one tablespoonful of
flour, one cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter. Stir
lightly together and bake with upper and under crust.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RHUBARB PIE.</b></p>
<p>Cut the large stalks off where the leaves commence, strip off
the outside skin, then cut the stalks in pieces half an inch long;
line a pie dish with paste rolled rather thicker than a dollar
piece, put a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 334]</span><a name=
'Page_334' id="Page_334"></a>layer of the rhubarb nearly an inch
deep; to a quart bowl of cut rhubarb put a large teacupful of
sugar; strew it over with a saltspoonful of salt and a little
nutmeg grated; shake over a little flour; cover with a rich pie
crust, cut a slit in the centre, trim off the edge with a sharp
knife and bake in a quick oven until the pie loosens from the dish.
Rhubarb pies made in this way are altogether superior to those made
of the fruit stewed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RHUBARB PIE. (Cooked.)</b></p>
<p>Skin the stalks, cut them into small pieces, wash and put them
in a stewpan with no more water than what adheres to them; when
cooked, mash them fine and put in a small piece of butter; when
cool, sweeten to taste; if liked, add a little lemon-peel, cinnamon
or nutmeg; line your plate with thin crust, put in the filling,
cover with crust and bake in a <i>quick</i> oven; sift sugar over
it when served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PINEAPPLE PIE.</b></p>
<p>A grated pineapple, its weight in sugar, half its weight in
butter, one cupful of cream, five eggs; beat the batter to a creamy
froth, add the sugar and yolks of the eggs, continue beating till
very light; add the cream, the pineapple grated and the whites of
the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Bake with an under crust. Eat
cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRAPE PIE.</b></p>
<p>Pop the pulps out of the skins into one dish and put the skins
into another. Then simmer the pulp a little over the fire to soften
it; remove it and rub it through a colander to separate it from the
seeds. Then put the skins and pulp together and they are ready for
pies or for canning or putting in jugs for other use. Fine for
pies.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DAMSON OR PLUM PIE.</b></p>
<p>Stew the damsons whole in water only sufficient to prevent their
burning; when tender and while hot, sweeten them with sugar and let
them stand until they become cold; then pour them into pie dishes
lined with paste, dredge flour upon them, cover them with the same
paste, wet and pinch together the edges of the paste, cut a slit in
the centre of the cover through which the vapor may escape and bake
twenty minutes.</p>

<p><b>PEACH PIE.</b></p>
<p>Peel, stone and slice the peaches. Line a pie plate with crust
and lay in your fruit, sprinkling sugar liberally over them in
proportion to their sweetness. Allow three peach kernels chopped
fine to each pie; pour in a very little water and bake with an
upper crust, or with cross-bars of paste across the top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRIED FRUIT PIES.</b></p>
<p>Wash the fruit thoroughly, soak over night in water enough to
cover. In the morning stew slowly until nearly done in the same
water. Sweeten to taste. The crust, both upper and under, should be
rolled thin; a thick crust to a fruit pie is undesirable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RIPE BERRY PIES.</b></p>
<p>All made the same as "Cherry Pie." Line your pie-tin with crust,
fill half full of berries, shake over a tablespoonful of sifted
flour (if very juicy) and as much sugar as is necessary to sweeten
sufficiently. Now fill up the crust to the top, making quite full.
Cover with crust and bake about forty minutes.</p>
<p>Huckleberry and blackberry pies are improved by putting into
them a little ginger and cinnamon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JELLY AND PRESERVED FRUIT PIES.</b></p>
<p>Preserved fruit requires no baking; hence, always bake the shell
and put in the sweetmeats afterwards; you can cover with whipped
cream, or bake a top crust shell; the former is preferable for
delicacy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRANBERRY PIE.</b></p>
<p>Take fine, sound, ripe cranberries and with a sharp knife split
each one until you have a heaping coffeecupful; put them in a
vegetable dish or basin; put over them one cupful of white sugar,
half a cup of water, a tablespoon <i>full</i> of sifted flour; stir
it all together and put into your crust. Cover with an upper crust
and bake slowly in a moderate oven. You will find this the true way
of making a cranberry pie.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Newport Style.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>CRANBERRY TART PIE.</b></p>
<p>After having washed and picked over the berries, stew them well
in a little water, just enough to cover them; when they burst open
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 336]</span><a name='Page_336' id=
"Page_336"></a>and become soft, sweeten them with plenty of sugar,
mash them smooth (some prefer them not mashed); line your
pie-plates with thin puff paste, fill them and lay strips of paste
across the top. Bake in a moderate oven. Or you may rub them
through a colander to free them from the skins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOOSEBERRY PIE.</b></p>
<p>Can be made the same as "Cranberry Tart Pie," or an upper crust
can be put on before baking. Serve with boiled custard or a pitcher
of good sweet cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED PUMPKIN OR SQUASH FOR PIES.</b></p>
<p>Deep-colored pumpkins are generally the best. Cut a pumpkin or
squash in half, take out the seeds, then cut it up in thick slices,
pare the outside and cut again in small pieces. Put it into a large
pot or saucepan with a very little water; let it cook slowly until
tender. Now set the pot on the back of the stove, where it will not
burn, and cook slowly, stirring often until the moisture is dried
out and the pumpkin looks dark and red. It requires cooking a long
time, at least half a day, to have it dry and rich. When cool press
through a colander.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED PUMPKIN OR SQUASH FOR PIES.</b></p>
<p>Cut up in several pieces, do not pare it; place them on baking
tins and set them in the oven; bake slowly until soft, then take
them out, scrape all the pumpkin from the shell, rub it through a
colander. It will be fine and light and free from lumps.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PUMPKIN PIE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>For three pies: One quart of milk, three cupfuls of boiled and
strained pumpkin, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one-half
cupful of molasses, the yolks and whites of four eggs beaten
separately, a little salt, one tablespoonful each of ginger and
cinnamon. Beat all together and bake with an under crust.</p>
<p>Boston marrow or Hubbard squash may be substituted for pumpkin
and are much preferred by many, as possessing a less strong
flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PUMPKIN PIE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>One quart of stewed pumpkin pressed through a sieve, nine eggs,
whites and yolks beaten separately, two scant quarts of milk, one
tea<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 337]</span><a name='Page_337' id=
"Page_337"></a>spoonful of mace, one teaspoonful of cinnamon and
the same of nutmeg, one and one-half cupfuls of white sugar, or
very light brown. Beat all well together and bake in crust without
cover.</p>
<p>A tablespoonful of brandy is a great improvement to pumpkin, or
squash pies.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PUMPKIN PIE WITHOUT EGGS.</b></p>
<p>One quart of properly stewed pumpkin pressed through a colander;
to this add enough good, rich milk, sufficient to moisten it enough
to fill two good-sized earthen pie-plates, a teaspoonful of salt,
half a cupful of molasses or brown sugar, a tablespoonful of
ginger, one teaspoonful of cinnamon or nutmeg. Bake in a moderately
slow oven three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SQUASH PIE.</b></p>
<p>One pint of boiled dry squash, one cupful of brown sugar, three
eggs, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, one tablespoonful of melted
butter one tablespoonful of ginger, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, a
pinch of salt and one pint of milk. This makes two pies, or one
large deep one.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWEET POTATO PIE.</b></p>
<p>One pound of steamed sweet potatoes finely mashed,-two cups
sugar, one cup cream, one-half cup butter, three well-beaten eggs,
flavor with lemon or nutmeg and bake in pastry shell. Fine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COOKED MEAT FOR MINCE PIES.</b></p>
<p>In order to succeed in having good mince pie, it is quite
essential to cook the meat properly, so as to retain its juices and
strength of flavor.</p>
<p>Select four pounds of lean beef, the neck piece is as good as
any; wash it and put it into a kettle with just water enough to
cover it; take off the scum as it reaches the boiling point, add
hot water from time to time, until it is tender, then season with
salt and pepper; take off the cover and let it boil until almost
dry, or until the juice has boiled back into the meat. When it
looks as though it was beginning to fry in its own juice, it is
time to take up and set aside to get cold, which should be done the
day before needed. Next day, when making the mince meat, the bones,
gristle and stringy bits should be well picked out before
chopping.</p>

<p><b>MINCE PIES. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>The "Astor House," some years ago, was <i>famous</i> for its
"mince pies." The chief pastry cook at that time, by request,
published the recipe. I find that those who partake of it never
fail to speak in laudable terms of the superior excellence of this
recipe when strictly followed.</p>
<p>Four pounds of lean boiled beef chopped fine, twice as much of
chopped green tart apples, one pound of chopped suet, three pounds
of raisins, seeded, two pounds of currants picked over, washed and
dried, half a pound of citron, cut up fine, one pound of brown
sugar, one quart of cooking molasses, two quarts of sweet cider,
one pint of boiled cider, one tablespoonful of salt, one
tablespoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of mace, one
tablespoonful of allspice and four tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two
grated nutmegs, one tablespoonful of cloves; mix thoroughly and
warm it on the range until heated through. Remove from the fire and
when nearly cool, stir in a pint of good brandy and one pint of
Madeira wine. Put into a crock, cover it tightly and set it in a
cold place where it will not freeze, but keep perfectly cold. Will
keep good all winter.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Chef de Cuisine, Astor House, N. Y.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>MINCE PIES. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Two pounds of lean fresh beef, boiled and, when cold, chopped

<br>
<p><b>MOCK MINCE MEAT WITHOUT MEAT.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of cold water, half a cupful of molasses, half a
cupful of brown sugar, half a cupful of cider vinegar, two-thirds
of a cupful <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 339]</span><a name='Page_339'

<br>
<p><b>FRUIT TURNOVERS. (Suitable for Picnics.)</b></p>
<p>Make a nice puff paste; roll it out the usual thickness, as for
pies; then cut it out into circular pieces about the size of a
small tea saucer; pile the fruit on half of the paste, sprinkle
over some sugar, wet the edges and turn the paste over. Press the
edges together, ornament them and brush the turnovers over with the
white of an egg; sprinkle over sifted sugar and bake on tins, in a
brisk oven, for about twenty minutes. Instead of putting the fruit
in raw, it may be boiled down with a little sugar first and then
enclosed in the crust; or jam of any kind may be substituted for
fresh fruit.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLUM CUSTARD TARTLETS.</b></p>
<p>One pint of greengage plums, after being rubbed through a sieve,
one large cup of sugar, the yolks of two eggs well beaten. Whisk
all together until light and foamy, then bake in small patty-pans
shells of puff paste a light brown. Then fill with the plum paste,
beat the two whites until stiff, add two tablespoonfuls of powdered
sugar, spread over the plum paste and set the shells into a
moderate oven for a few moments.</p>
<p>These are much more easily handled than pieces of pie or even
pies whole, and can be packed nicely for carrying.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON TARTLETS. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Put a quart of milk into a saucepan over the fire. When it comes
to the boiling point put into it the following mixture: Into a bowl
put a heaping tablespoonful of flour, half a cupful of sugar and a
pinch of salt. Stir this all together thoroughly; then add the
beaten yolks of six eggs; stir this one way into the boiling milk
until cooked to a thick cream; remove from the fire and stir into
it the grated rind and juice of one large lemon. Have ready baked
and hot some puff paste tart <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
340]</span><a name='Page_340' id="Page_340"></a>shells. Fill them
with the custard and cover each with a meringue made of the whites
of the eggs, sweetened with four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Put into
the oven and bake a light straw color.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON TARTLETS. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Mix well together the juice and grated rind of two lemons, two

all together until smooth; put into twelve patty-pans lined with
puff paste and bake until the crust is done.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE TARTLETS.</b></p>
<p>Take the juice of two large oranges and the grated peel of one,
three-fourths of a cup of sugar, a tablespoonful of butter; stir in
a good teaspoonful of cornstarch into the juice of half a lemon and
add to the mixture. Beat all well together and bake in tart shells
without cover.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MERINGUE CUSTARD TARTLETS.</b></p>
<p>Select deep individual pie-tins; fluted tartlet pans are
suitable for custard tarts, but they should be about six inches in
diameter and from two to three inches deep. Butter the pan and line
it with ordinary puff paste, then fill it with a custard made as
follows: Stir gradually into the beaten yolks of six eggs two
tablespoonfuls of flour, a saltspoonful of salt and half a pint of
cream. Stir until free from lumps and add two tablespoonfuls of
sugar; put the saucepan on the range and stir until the custard
coats the spoon. Do not let it boil or it will curdle. Pour it in a
bowl, add a few drops of vanilla flavoring and stir until the
custard becomes cold; fill the lined mold with this and bake in a
moderate oven. In the meantime, put the whites of the eggs in a
bright copper vessel and beat thoroughly, using a baker's wire
egg-beater for this purpose. While beating, sprinkle in lightly
half a pound of sugar and a dash of salt. When the paste is quite
firm, spread a thin layer of it over the tart and decorate the top
with the remainder by squeezing it through a paper funnel. Strew a
little powdered sugar over the top, return to the oven, and when a
delicate yellow tinge remove from the oven and when cold serve.</p>

of sweet cream. They form a delicious addition to the breakfast
table.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM STRAWBERRY TARTS.</b></p>
<p>After picking over the berries carefully, arrange them in layers
in a deep pie-tin lined with puff paste, sprinkling sugar thickly
between each layer: fill the pie-tin pretty full, pouring in a
quantity of the juice: cover with a thick crust, with a slit in the
top and bake. When the pie is baked, pour into the slit in the top
of the pie the following cream mixture: Take a small cupful of the
cream from the top of the morning's milk, heat it until it comes to
a boil, then stir into it the whites of two eggs beaten light, also
a tablespoonful of white sugar and a teaspoonful of cornstarch wet
in cold milk. Boil all together a few moments until quite smooth;
set it aside and when cool pour it into the pie through the slit in
the crust. Serve it cold with powdered sugar sifted over it.</p>

"CUSTARDS_CREAMS_AND_DESSERTS"></a>
<h2><b>CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND DESSERTS.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>The usual rule for custards is, eight eggs to a quart of milk;
but a very good custard can be made of six, or even less,
especially with the addition of a level tablespoonful of sifted
flour, thoroughly blended in the sugar first, before adding the
other ingredients. They may be baked, boiled or steamed, either in
cups or one large dish. It improves custard to first boil the milk
and then cool it before being used; also a little salt adds to the
flavor. A very small lump of butter may also be added, if one wants
something especially rich.</p>
<p>To make custards look and taste better, duck's eggs should be
used when obtainable; they add very much to the flavor and
richness, and so many are not required as of ordinary eggs, four
duck's eggs to the pint of milk making a delicious custard. When
desired extremely rich and good, cream should be substituted for
the milk, and double the quantity of eggs used to those mentioned,
omitting the whites.</p>
<p>When making boiled custard, set the dish containing the custard
into another and larger dish, partly filled with boiling water,
placed over the fire. Let the cream or milk come almost to a boil
before adding the eggs or thickening, then stir it briskly one way
every moment until smooth and well cooked; it must <i>not</i> boil
or it will curdle.</p>
<p>To bake a custard, the fire should be moderate and the dish well
buttered.</p>
<p>Everything in baked custard depends upon the <i>regularly heated
slow</i> oven. If made with nicety it is the most delicate of all
sweets; if cooked till it wheys it is hardly eatable.</p>
<p>Frozen eggs can be made quite as good as fresh ones if used as
soon as thawed soft. Drop them into boiling water, letting them
remain until the water is cold. They will be soft all through and
beat up equal to those that have not been touched with the
frost.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 345]</span><a name='Page_345' id=
"Page_345"></a>
<p>Eggs should always be thoroughly well beaten separately, the
yolks first, then the sugar added, beat again, then add the beaten
whites with the flavoring, then the cooled scalded milk. The
lighter the eggs are beaten, the thicker and richer the
custard.</p>
<p>Eggs should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks
separated, and they should always be strained. Breaking the eggs
thus, the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the
others and so cause no waste.</p>
<p>A meringue, or frosting for the top, requires about a
tablespoonful of fine sugar to the beaten white of one egg; to be
placed on the top after the custard or pudding is baked, smoothed
over with a broad-bladed knife dipped in cold water, and replaced
in the oven to brown slightly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOFT CARAMEL CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>One quart of milk, half a cupful of sugar, six eggs, half a
teaspoonful of salt. Put the milk on to boil, reserving a cupful.
Beat the eggs and add the cold milk to them. Stir the sugar in a
small frying pan until it becomes liquid and just begins to smoke.
Stir it into the boiling milk; then add the beaten eggs and cold
milk and stir constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Set
away to cool. Serve in glasses.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Beat five fresh eggs, the whites and yolks separately, the yolks
with half a cup of sugar, the whites to a stiff froth; then stir
them gradually into a quart of sweet rich milk previously boiled
and cooled; flavor with extract of lemon or vanilla and half a
teaspoonful of salt. Rub butter over the bottom and sides of a
baking-dish or tin basin; pour in the custard, grate a little
nutmeg over and bake in a quick oven. It is better to set the dish
in a shallow pan of hot water reaching nearly to the top, the water
to be kept boiling until the custard is baked; three-quarters of an
hour is generally enough. Run a teaspoon handle into the middle of
it; if it comes out clean it is baked sufficiently.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUP CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Six eggs half a cupful of sugar, one quart of new milk. Beat the
eggs and the sugar and milk, and any extract or flavoring you like.
Fill your custard cups, sift a little nutmeg or cinnamon over the
tops, set them in a moderate oven in a shallow pan half filled with
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 346]</span><a name='Page_346' id=
"Page_346"></a>hot water. In about twenty minutes try them with the
handle of a teaspoon to see if they are firm. Judgment and great
care are needed to attain skill in baking custard, for if left in
the oven a minute too long, or if the fire is too hot, the milk
will certainly whey.</p>
<p>Serve cold with fresh fruit sugared and placed on top of each.
Strawberries, peaches or raspberries, as preferred.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Beat seven eggs very light, omitting the whites of two; mix them
gradually with a quart of milk and half a cupful of sugar; boil in
a dish set in another of boiling water; add flavoring. As soon as
it comes to the boiling point remove it, or it will be liable to
curdle and become lumpy. Whip the whites of the two eggs that
remain, adding two heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar. When the
custard is cold heap this on top; if in cups, put on a strawberry
or a bit of red jelly on each. Set in a cold place till wanted.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Common Sense in the Household.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED CUSTARD, OR MOCK CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Take two even tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, one quart of milk,
three eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt and a small piece of butter;
heat the milk to nearly boiling and add the starch, previously
dissolved in a little cold milk; then add the eggs well beaten with
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; let it boil up once or
twice, stirring it briskly, and it is done. Flavor with lemon, or
vanilla, or raspberry, or to suit your taste.</p>
<p>A good substitute for ice cream, served <i>very</i> cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>One quart of milk, eight eggs, sugar and cinnamon to taste;
separate the eggs, beat the yolks until thick, to which add the
milk, a little vanilla, and sweeten to taste; put it into a pan or
farina kettle, place it over a slow fire and stir it all the time
until it becomes custard; then pour it into a pudding-dish to get
cold; whisk the whites until stiff and dry; have ready a pan of
boiling water on the top of which place the whites; cover and place
them where the water will keep sufficiently hot to cause a steam to
pass through and cook them; place in a dish (suitable for the
table) a layer of custard and white alter<span class='pagenum'>[Pg
347]</span><a name='Page_347' id="Page_347"></a>nately; on each
layer of custard grate a little nutmeg with a teaspoonful of wine;
reserve a layer of white for the cover, over which grate nutmeg;
then send to table and eat cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GERMAN CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Add to a pint of good, rich, boiled custard an ounce of sweet
almonds, blanched, roasted and pounded to a paste, and half an
ounce of pine-nuts or peanuts, blanched, roasted and pounded; also
a small quantity of candied citron cut into the thinnest possible
slips; cook the custard as usual and set it on the ice for some
hours before using.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Pare, core and quarter a dozen large juicy pippins. Stew among
them the yellow peel of a large lemon grated very fine, and stew
them till tender in a very small portion of water. When done, mash
them smooth with the back of a spoon (you must have a pint and a
half of the stewed apple); mix a half cupful of sugar with them and
set them away till cold. Beat six eggs very light and stir them
gradually into a quart of rich milk alternately with the stewed
apple. Put the mixture into cups, or into a deep dish and bake it
about twenty minutes. Send it to table cold, with nutmeg grated
over the top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALMOND CUSTARD. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Scald and blanch half a pound of shelled sweet almonds and three
ounces of bitter almonds, throwing them, as you do them, into a
large bowl of cold water. Then pound them one at a time into a
paste, adding a few drops of wine or rose-water to them. Beat eight
eggs very light with two-thirds of a cup of sugar, then mix
together with a quart of rich milk, or part milk and part cream;
put the mixture into a saucepan and set it over the fire. Stir it
one way until it begins to thicken, but not till it curdles; remove
from the fire and when it is cooled put in a glass dish. Having
reserved part of the whites of the eggs, beat them to a stiff
froth, season with three tablespoonfuls of sugar and a teaspoonful
of lemon extract, spread over the top of the custard. Serve
cold.</p>

a sieve and pour into it the other mixture; stir the whole over the
fire until it thickens and is smooth; then pour it into your mold
and keep it upon ice, or in a cool place, until wanted; when ready
to serve dip the mold into warm water, rub it with a cloth and turn
out the cream carefully upon your dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SNOWBALL CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Soak half a package of Cox's gelatine in a teacupful of cold
water one hour, to which add a pint of boiling water, stir it until
the gelatine is thoroughly dissolved. Then beat the whites of four
eggs to a stiff froth, put two teacupfuls of sugar in the gelatine
water first, then the beaten white of egg and one teaspoonful of
vanilla extract, or the grated rind and the juice of a lemon. Whip
it some time until it is all quite stiff and cold. Dip some teacups
or wine-glasses in cold water and fill them; set in a cold
place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, make a boiled custard of the yolks of three of
the eggs, with half a cupful of sugar and a pint of milk; flavor
with vanilla extract. Now after the meringue in the cups has stood
four or five hours, turn them out of the molds, place them in a
glass dish and pour this custard around the base.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED COCOANUT CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Grate as much cocoanut as will weigh a pound. Mix half a pound
of powdered white sugar with the milk of the cocoanut, or with a

<p>Beat the yolks of the eggs well; put them into a basin with the
grated chocolate, the sugar and one pint of the cream; stir these
ingredients well together, pour them into a basin and set this
basin in a saucepan of boiling water; stir it one way until the
mixture thickens, but <i>do not allow it to boil</i>, or it will
curdle. Strain the cream through a sieve into a basin, stir in the
isinglass and the other one-half pint of cream, which should-be
well whipped; mix all well together, and pour it into a mold which
has been previously oiled with the purest salad oil, and, if at
hand, set it in ice until wanted for table.</p>

<p><b>CHOCOLATE CREAM OR CUSTARD. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Take one quart of milk, and when nearly boiling stir in two
ounces of grated chocolate; let it warm on the fire for a few
moments, and then remove and cool; beat the yolks of eight eggs and
two whites with eight tablespoonfuls of sugar, then pour the milk
over them; flavor and bake as any custard, either in cups or a
large dish. Make a meringue of the remaining whites.</p>
<br>

<p>One pint of cream, the yolks of two eggs, one quarter of a pound
of white sugar, one large lemon, one ounce isinglass or
gelatine.</p>
<p>Put the cream into a <i>lined</i> saucepan with the sugar, lemon
peel and isinglass, and simmer these over a gentle fire for about
ten minutes, stirring them all the time. Strain the cream into a
basin, add the yolks of eggs, which should be well beaten, and put
the basin into a saucepan of boiling water; stir the mixture one
way until it thickens, <i>but do not allow it to boil</i>; take it
off the fire and keep stirring it until nearly cold. Strain the
lemon juice into a basin, gradually pour on it the cream, and
<i>stir it well</i> until the juice is well mixed with it. Have
ready a well-oiled mold, pour the cream into it, and let it remain
until perfectly set. When required for table, loosen the edges with
a small blunt knife, put a dish on the top of the mold, turn it
over quickly, and the cream should easily slip away.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON CREAM. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Pare into one quart of boiling water the peels of four large
lemons, the yellow outside only; let it stand for four hours; then
take them out and add to the water the juice of the four lemons and
one cupful of fine white sugar. Beat the yolks of ten eggs and mix
all together; strain it through a piece of lawn or lace into a
porcelain lined stewpan; set it over a slow fire; stir it one way
until it is as thick as good cream, <i>but do not let it boil</i>;
then take it from the fire, and, when cool, serve in custard
cups.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON CREAM. No. 3.</b></p>
<p>Peel three lemons and squeeze out the juice into one quart of
milk. Add the peel; cut in pieces and cover the mixture for a few
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 352]</span><a name='Page_352' id=
"Page_352"></a>hours; then add six eggs, well beaten, and one pint
of water, well sweetened. Strain and simmer over a gentle fire till
it thickens; <i>do not let it boil.</i> Serve very cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Whip a pint of cream so long that there will be but one-half the
quantity left when skimmed off. Soak in half a cupful of cold water
a half package of gelatine and then grate over it the rind of two
oranges. Strain the juice of six oranges and add to it a cupful of
sugar; now put the half pint of unwhipped cream into a double
boiler, pour into it the well-beaten yolks of six eggs, stirring
until it begins to thicken, then add the gelatine. Remove from the
fire, let it stand for two minutes and add the orange juice and
sugar; beat all together until about the consistency of soft
custard and add the whipped cream. Mix well and turn into molds to
harden. To be served with sweetened cream. Fine.</p>

tablespoonfuls of brandy, the juice of one large lemon.</p>
<p>Strain the lemon juice over the sugar and add the brandy, then
stir in the cream, put the mixture into a pitcher and continue
pouring from one pitcher to another, until it is quite thick; or it
may be whisked until the desired consistency is obtained. It should
be served in jelly glasses.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BANANA CREAM.</b></p>
<p>After peeling the bananas, mash them with an iron or wooden
spoon; allow equal quantities of bananas and sweet cream; to one
quart of the mixture, allow one-quarter of a pound of sugar. Beat
them all together until the cream is light.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TAPIOCA CREAM CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Soak three heaping tablespoonfuls of tapioca in a teacupful of
water over night. Place over the fire a quart of milk; let it come
to a boil, then stir in the tapioca, a good pinch of salt, stir
until it thickens; then add a cupful of sugar and the beaten yolks
of three eggs. Stir it quickly and pour it into a dish and stir
gently into the mixture the whites beaten stiff, the flavoring and
set it on ice, or in an ice chest.</p>

<p><b>PEACH CREAM. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Mash very smooth two cupfuls of canned peaches, run them through
a sieve and cook for three minutes in a syrup made by boiling
together one cupful of sugar and stirring all the time. Place the
pan containing the syrup and peaches into another of boiling water
and add one-half packet of gelatine prepared the same as in
previous recipes, and stir for five minutes to thoroughly dissolve
the gelatine, then take it from the fire, place in a pan of
ice-water, beat until nearly cool and then add the well-frothed
whites of six eggs. Beat this whole mixture until it commences to
harden. Then pour into a mold, set away to cool and serve with
cream and sugar. It should be placed on the ice to cool for two or
three hours before serving.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH CREAM. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>A quart of fine peaches, pare and stone the fruit and cut in
quarters. Beat the whites of three eggs with a half cupful of
powdered sugar until it is stiff enough to cut with a knife. Take
the yolks and mix with half a cupful of granulated sugar and a pint
of milk. Put the peaches into the mixture, place in a pudding-dish
and bake until almost firm; then put in the whites, mixing all
thoroughly again, and bake a light brown. Eat ice cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ITALIAN CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Put two pints of cream into two bowls; with one bowl mix six
ounces of powdered loaf sugar, the juice of two large lemons and
two glassfuls of white wine; then add the other pint of cream and
stir the whole very hard; boil two ounces of isinglass or gelatine
with four small teacupfuls of water till reduced to one-half; then
stir the mixture luke-warm into the other ingredients; put them in
a glass dish to congeal.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SNOW CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Heat a quart of thick, sweet cream; when ready to boil, stir
into it quickly three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch flour, blended
with some cold cream; sweeten to taste and allow it to boil gently,
stirring for two or three minutes; add quickly the whites of six
eggs, beaten to a stiff froth; do not allow it to boil up more than
once after adding the eggs; flavor with lemon, vanilla, bitter
almond or grated lemon peel; lay the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg
354]</span><a name='Page_354' id="Page_354"></a> snow thus formed
quickly in rocky heaps on silver or glass dishes, or in shapes.
Iced, it will turn out well.</p>
<p>If the recipe is closely followed, any family may enjoy it at a
trifling expense, and it is really worthy the table of an epicure.
It can be made the day before it is to be eaten; kept cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOCK ICE.</b></p>
<p>Take about three tablespoonfuls of some good preserve; rub it
through a sieve with as much cream as will fill a quart mold;
dissolve three-quarters of an ounce of isinglass or gelatine in
half a pint of water; when almost cold, mix it well with the cream;
put it into a mold, set in a cool place and turn out next day.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH MERINGUE.</b></p>
<p>Pare and quarter (removing stones) a quart of sound, ripe
peaches; place them all in a dish that it will not injure to set in
the oven and yet be suitable to place on the table. Sprinkle the
peaches with sugar, and cover them well with the beaten whites of
three eggs. Stand the dish in the oven until the eggs have become a
delicate brown, then remove, and when cool enough, set the dish on
ice, or in a very cool place. Take the yolks of the eggs, add to
them a pint of milk, sweeten and flavor, and boil same in a custard
kettle, being careful to keep the eggs from curdling. When cool
pour into a glass pitcher and serve with the meringue when ready to
use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE FLOAT.</b></p>
<p>One dozen apples, pared and cored, one pound and a half of
sugar. Put the apples on with water enough to cover them and let
them stew until they look as if they would break; then take them
out and put the sugar in the same water; let the syrup come to a
boil, put in the apples and let them stew until done through and
clear; then take them out, slice into the syrup one large lemon and
add an ounce of gelatine dissolved in a pint of cold water. Let the
whole mix well and come to a boil; then pour upon the apples. The
syrup will congeal. It is to be eaten cold with cream.</p>
<p>Or you may change the dish by making a soft custard with the
yolks of four eggs, three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and a
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 355]</span><a name='Page_355' id=
"Page_355"></a>scant quart of milk. When cold, spread it over the
apples. Whip the whites of the egg, flavor with lemon and place on
the custard. Color in the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SYLLABUB.</b></p>
<p>One quart of rich milk or cream, a cupful of wine, half a cupful
of sugar; put the sugar and wine into a bowl and the milk lukewarm
in a separate vessel. When the sugar is dissolved in the wine, pour
the milk in, holding it high; pour it back and forth until it is
frothy. Grate nutmeg over it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM FOR FRUIT.</b></p>
<p>This recipe is an excellent substitute for pure cream, to be
eaten on fresh berries and fruit.</p>
<p>One cupful of sweet milk; heat it until boiling. Beat together
the whites of two eggs, a tablespoonful of white sugar and a piece
of butter the size of a nutmeg. Now add half a cupful of cold milk
and a teaspoonful of cornstarch; stir well together until very
light and smooth, then add it to the boiling milk; cook it until it
thickens; it must not boil. Set it aside to cool. It should be of
the consistency of real fresh cream. Serve in a creamer.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY SPONGE.</b></p>
<p>One quart of strawberries, half a package of gelatine, one
cupful and a half of water, one cupful of sugar, the juice of a
lemon, the whites of four eggs. Soak the gelatine for two hours in
half a cupful of the water. Mash the strawberries and add half the
sugar to them. Boil the remainder of the sugar and the water gently
twenty minutes. Rub the strawberries through a sieve. Add the
gelatine to the boiling syrup and take from the fire immediately;
then add the strawberries. Place in a pan of ice-water and beat
five minutes. Add the whites of eggs and beat until the mixture
begins to thicken. Pour in the molds and set away to harden. Serve
with sugar and cream. Raspberry and blackberry sponges are made in
the same way.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON SPONGE.</b></p>
<p>Lemon sponge is made from the juice of four lemons, four eggs, a
cupful of sugar, half a package of gelatine and one pint of water.
Strain lemon juice on the sugar; beat the yolks of the eggs and mix
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 356]</span><a name='Page_356' id=
"Page_356"></a>with the remainder of the water, having used a half
cupful of the pint in which to soak the gelatine. Add the sugar and
lemon to this and cook until it begins to thicken, then add the
gelatine. Strain this into a basin, which place in a pan of water
to cool. Beat with a whisk until it has cooled but not hardened;
now add the whites of the eggs until it begins to thicken, turn in
a mold and set to harden.</p>
<p>Remember the sponge hardens very rapidly when it commences to
cool, so have your molds all ready. Serve with powdered sugar and
cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE SNOW.</b></p>
<p>Stew some fine-flavored sour apples tender, sweeten to taste,
strain them through a fine wire sieve and break into one pint of
strained apples the white of an egg; whisk the apple and egg very
briskly till quite stiff and it will be as white as snow; eaten
with a nice boiled custard it makes a very desirable dessert. More
eggs may be used if liked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>QUINCE SNOW.</b></p>
<p>Quarter five fair-looking quinces and boil them till they are
tender in water, then peel them and push them through a coarse
sieve. Sweeten to the taste and add the whites of three or four
eggs. Then with an egg-whisk beat all to a stiff froth and pile
with a spoon upon a glass dish and set away in the ice box, unless
it is to be served immediately.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE TRIFLE.</b></p>
<p>Take the thin parings from the outside of a dozen oranges and
put to steep in a wide-mouthed bottle; cover it with good cognac
and let it stand twenty-four hours; skin and seed the oranges and
reduce to a pulp; press this through a sieve, sugar to taste,
arrange in a dish and heap with whipped cream flavored with the
orange brandy, ice two hours before serving.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON TRIFLE.</b></p>
<p>The juice of two lemons and grated peel of one, one pint of
cream, well sweetened and whipped stiff, one cupful of sherry, a
little nutmeg. Let sugar, lemon juice and peel lie together two
hours before you add wine and nutmeg. Strain through double
tarlatan and whip gradually into the frothed cream. Serve very soon
heaped in small glasses. Nice with cake.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 357]</span><a name='Page_357' id=
"Page_357"></a>
<p><b>FRUIT TRIFLE.</b></p>
<p>Whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, two tablespoonfuls
each of sugar, currant jelly and raspberry jam. Eaten with sponge
cakes, it is a delicious dessert.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRAPE TRIFLE.</b></p>
<p>Pulp through a sieve two pounds of ripe grapes, enough to keep
back the stones, add sugar to taste. Put into a trifle dish and
cover &gt; with whipped cream, nicely flavored. Serve very
cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE TRIFLE.</b></p>
<p>Peel, core and quarter some good tart apples of nice flavor, and
stew them with a strip of orange and a strip of quince peel,
sufficient water to cover the bottom of the stewpan, and sugar in
the proportion of half a pound to one pound of fruit; when cooked,
press the pulp through a sieve, and, when cold, dish and cover with
one pint of whipped cream flavored with lemon peel.</p>
<p>Quinces prepared in the same manner are equally as good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH TRIFLE.</b></p>
<p>Select perfect, fresh peaches, peel and core and cut in
quarters; they should be <i>well sugared</i>, arranged in a trifle
dish with a few of their own blanched kernels among them, then
heaped with whipped cream as above; the cream should not be
flavored; this trifle should be set on the ice for at least an hour
before serving; home-made sponge cakes should be served with
it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOOSEBERRY TRIFLE.</b></p>
<p>One quart of gooseberries, sugar to taste, one pint of custard,
a plateful of whipped cream.</p>
<p>Put the gooseberries into a jar, with sufficient moist sugar to
sweeten them, and boil them until reduced to a pulp. Put this pulp
at the bottom of a trifle dish; pour over it a pint of custard,
and, when cold, cover with whipped cream. The cream should be
whipped the day before it is wanted for table, as it will then be
so much firmer and more solid. This dish may be garnished as fancy
dictates.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 358]</span><a name='Page_358' id=

<p><b>LEMON HONEY.</b></p>
<p>One coffeecupful of white sugar, the grated rind and juice of
one large lemon, the yolks of three eggs and the white of one, a
tablespoonful of butter. Put into a basin the sugar and butter, set
it in a dish of boiling water over the fire; while this is melting,
beat up the eggs, and add to them the grated rind from the outside
of the lemon; then add this to the sugar and butter, cooking and
stirring it until it is thick and clear like honey.</p>
<p>This will keep for some days, put into a tight preserve jar, and
is nice for flavoring pies, etc.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLOATING ISLANDS.</b></p>
<p>Beat the yolks of five eggs and the whites of two very light,
sweeten with five tablespoonfuls of sugar and flavor to taste; stir
them into a quart of scalded milk and cook it until it thickens.
When cool pour it into a glass dish. Now whip the whites of the
three remaining eggs to a <i>stiff</i> froth, adding three
tablespoonfuls of sugar and a little flavoring. Pour this froth
over a shallow dish of boiling water; the steam passing through it
cooks it; when sufficiently cooked, take a tablespoon and drop
spoonfuls of this over the top of the custard, far enough apart so
that the "little white islands" will not touch each other. By
dropping a teaspoonful of bright jelly on the top or centre of each
island, is produced a pleasing effect; also by filling wine-glasses
and arranging them around a standard adds much to the appearance of
the table.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLOATING ISLAND.</b></p>
<p>One quart of milk, five eggs and five tablespoonfuls of sugar.
Scald the milk, then add the beaten yolks and one of the whites
together with the sugar. First stir into them a little of the
scalded milk to prevent curdling, then all of the milk. Cook it the
proper thickness; remove from the fire, and, when cool, flavor;
then pour it into a glass dish and let it become very cold. Before
it is served beat up the remaining four whites of the eggs to a
<i>stiff</i> froth and beat into them three tablespoonfuls of sugar
and two tablespoonfuls of currant jelly. Dip this over the top of
the custard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TAPIOCA BLANC MANGE.</b></p>
<p>Half a pound of tapioca soaked an hour in one pint of milk and
boiled till tender; add a pinch of salt, sweeten to taste and put
into a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 359]</span><a name='Page_359' id=

strawberry or raspberry jam around it and a little cream. Flavor
with lemon or vanilla.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLANC MANGE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>In one teacupful of water boil until dissolved one ounce of
clarified isinglass, or of patent gelatine (which is better); stir
it continually, while boiling. Then squeeze the juice of a lemon
upon a cupful of fine, white sugar; stir the sugar into a quart of
rich cream and half a pint of Madeira or sherry wine; when it is
well mixed, add the dissolved isinglass or gelatine, stir all well
together, pour it into molds previously wet with cold water; set
the molds upon ice, let them stand until their contents are hard
and cold, then serve with sugar and cream or custard sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLANC MANGE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Dissolve two ounces of patent gelatine in cold water; when it is
dissolved stir it into two quarts of rich milk, with a teacupful of
fine white sugar; season it to your taste with lemon, or vanilla,
or peach water; place it over the fire and boil it, stirring it
continually; let it boil five minutes; then strain it through a
cloth, pour it into molds previously wet with cold water and salt;
let it stand on ice, or in any cool place until it becomes hard and
cold; turn it out carefully upon dishes and serve; or, half fill
your mold; when this has set, cover with cherries, peaches in
halves, strawberries or sliced bananas, and add the remainder.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE BLANC MANGE.</b></p>
<p>Half a box of gelatine soaked in a cupful of water for an hour,
half a cupful of grated chocolate, rubbed smooth in a little milk.
Boil two cupfuls of milk, then add the gelatine and chocolate and
one cupful of sugar; boil all together eight or ten minutes. Remove
from the fire, and when nearly cold beat into this the whipped
whites of three eggs, flavored with vanilla. Should be served cold
with custard made of the yolks, or sugar and cream. Set the molds
in a cold place.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CORNSTARCH BLANC MANGE.</b></p>
<p>Take one quart of sweet milk and put one pint upon the stove to
heat; in the other pint mix four heaping tablespoonfuls of
cornstarch and half a cupful of sugar; when the milk is hot, pour
in the cold milk with the cornstarch and sugar thoroughly mixed in
it and stir alto<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 360]</span><a name=
'Page_360' id="Page_360"></a>gether until there are no lumps and it
is thick; flavor with lemon; take from the stove and add the whites
of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth.</p>
<p><i>A Custard for the above.</i>&mdash;One pint of milk boiled
with a little salt in it; beat the yolks of three eggs with half a
cupful of sugar and add to the boiling milk; stir well, but do not
let it boil until the eggs are put in; flavor to taste.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT BLANC MANGE.</b></p>
<p>Stew nice, fresh fruit (cherries, raspberries and strawberries
being the best), or canned ones will do; strain off the juice and
sweeten to taste; place it over the fire in a double kettle until
it boils; while boiling, stir in cornstarch wet with a little cold
water, allowing two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch to each pint of
juice; continue stirring until sufficiently cooked; then pour into
molds wet in cold water and set away to cool. Served with cream and
sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE CHARLOTTE.</b></p>
<p>For two molds of medium size, soak half a box of gelatine in
half a cupful of water for two hours. Add one and a half cupfuls of
boiling water and strain. Then add two cupfuls of sugar, one of
orange juice and pulp and the juice of one lemon. Stir until the
mixture begins to cool, or about five minutes; then add the whites
of six eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Beat the whole until so stiff
that it will only just pour into molds lined with sections of
orange. Set away to cool.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY CHARLOTTE.</b></p>
<p>Make a boiled custard of one quart of milk, the yolks of six
eggs and three-quarters of a cupful of sugar; flavor to taste. Line
a glass fruit-dish with slices of sponge cake dipped in sweet
cream; lay upon this ripe strawberries sweetened to taste; then a
layer of cake and strawberries as before. When the custard is cold
pour over the whole. Now beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff
froth, add a tablespoonful of sugar to each egg and put over the
top. Decorate the top with the largest berries saved out at the

<p><b>CHARLOTTE RUSSE. (Fine.)</b></p>
<p>Whip one quart of rich cream to a stiff froth and drain well on
a nice sieve. To one scant pint of milk add six eggs beaten very
light; make very sweet; flavor high with vanilla. Cook over hot
water till it is a thick custard. Soak one full ounce of Cox's
gelatine in a very little water and warm over hot water. When the
custard is very cold beat in lightly the gelatine and the whipped
cream. Line the bottom of your mold with buttered paper, the side
with sponge cake or lady-fingers fastened together with the white
of an egg. Fill with the cream, put in a cold place, or, in summer,
on ice. To turn out, dip the mold for a moment in hot water. In
draining the whipped cream, all that drips through can be
re-whipped.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHARLOTTE RUSSE.</b></p>
<p>Cut stale sponge cake into slices about half an inch thick and
line three molds with them, leaving a space of half an inch between
each slice; set the molds where they will not be disturbed until
the filling is ready. Take a deep tin pan and fill about one-third
full of either snow or pounded ice and into this set another pan
that will hold at least four quarts. Into a deep bowl or pail (a
whip churn is better) put one and a half pints of cream (if the
cream is very thick take one pint of cream and a half pint of
milk); whip it to a froth and when the bowl is full, skim the froth
into the pan which is standing on the ice and repeat this until the
cream is all froth; then with a spoon draw the froth to one side
and you will find that some of the cream has gone back to milk;
turn this into the bowl again and whip as before; when the cream is
all whipped, stir into it two-thirds of a cup of powdered sugar,
one teaspoonful of vanilla and half of a box of gelatine, which has
been soaked in cold water enough to cover it for one hour and then
put in boiling water enough to dissolve it (about half a cup); stir
from the bottom of the pan until it begins to grow stiff; fill the
molds and set them on ice in the pan for one hour, or until they
are sent to the table. When ready to dish them, loosen lightly at
the sides and turn out on a flat dish. Have the cream ice cold when
you begin to whip it; and it is a good plan to put a lump of ice
into the cream while whipping it.</p>

<p><b>PLAIN CHARLOTTE RUSSE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Make a rule of white sponge cake; bake in narrow shallow pans.
Then make a custard of the yolks after this recipe. Wet a saucepan
with cold water to prevent the milk that will be scalded in it from
burning. Pour out the water and put in a quart of milk, boil and
partly cool. Beat up the yolks of six eggs and add three ounces of

cream; do not allow it to boil, as that would curdle it; strain,
and when almost cold add two teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Now, having
arranged your cake (cut into inch slices) around the sides and on
the bottom of a glass dish, pour over the custard. If you wish a
meringue on the top, beat up the whites of four eggs with four
tablespoonfuls of sugar; flavor with lemon or vanilla, spread over
the top and brown slightly in the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN CHARLOTTE RUSSE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Put some thin slices of sponge cake in the bottom of a glass
sauce dish; pour in wine enough to soak it; beat up the whites of
three eggs until very light; add to it three tablespoonfuls of
finely powdered sugar, a glass of sweet wine and one pint of thick
sweet cream; beat it well and pour over the cake. Set it in a cold
place until served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NAPLE BISCUITS, OR CHARLOTTE RUSSE.</b></p>
<p>Make a double rule of sponge cake; bake it in round deep
patty-pans; when cold cut out the inside about one-quarter of an
inch from the edge and bottom, leaving the shell. Replace the
inside with a cus<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 363]</span><a name=
'Page_363' id="Page_363"></a>tard made of the yolks of four eggs
beaten with a pint of boiling milk, sweetened and flavored; lay on
the top of this some jelly or jam; beat the whites of three eggs
with three heaping tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar until it will
stand in a heap; flavor it a little; place this on the jelly. Set
them aside in a cold place until time to serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ECONOMICAL CHARLOTTE RUSSE.</b></p>
<p>Make a quart of nicely flavored mock custard, put it into a
large glass fruit dish, which is partly filled with stale cake (of
any kind) cut up into small pieces about an inch square, stir it a
little, then beat the whites of two or more eggs stiff, sweetened
with white sugar; spread over the top, set in a refrigerator to
become cold.</p>
<p>Or, to be still more economical: To make the cream, take a pint
and a half of milk, set it on the stove to boil; mix together in a
bowl the following named articles: large half cup of sugar, one
moderately heaped teaspoonful of cornstarch, two tablespoonfuls of
grated chocolate one egg, a small half cup of milk and a pinch of
salt. Pour into the boiling milk, remove to top of the stove and
let simmer a minute or two. When the cream is cold pour over the
cake just before setting it on the table. Serve in saucers. If you
do not have plenty of eggs you can use all cornstarch, about two
heaping teaspoonfuls; but be careful and not get the cream too
thick, and have it free from lumps.</p>
<p>The cream should be flavored either with vanilla or lemon
extract. Nutmeg might answer.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TIPSY CHARLOTTE.</b></p>
<p>Take a stale sponge cake, cut the bottom and sides of it, so as
to make it stand even in a glass fruit dish; make a few deep gashes
through it with a sharp knife, pour over it a pint of good wine,
let it stand and soak into the cake. In the meantime, blanch, peel
and slice lengthwise half a pound of sweet almonds; stick them all
over the top of the cake. Have ready a pint of good boiled custard,
well flavored, and pour over the whole. To be dished with a spoon.
This is equally as good as any charlotte.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE CHARLOTTE.</b></p>
<p>One-third of a box of gelatine, one-third of a cupful of cold
water, one-third of a cupful of boiling water and one cup of sugar,
the juice of one lemon and one cupful of orange juice and pulp, a
little grated <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 364]</span><a name=
'Page_364' id="Page_364"></a>orange peel and the whites of four
eggs. Soak the gelatine in the cold water one hour. Pour the
boiling water over the lemon and orange juice, cover it and let
stand half an hour; then add the sugar, let it come to a boil on
the fire, stir in the gelatine and when it is thoroughly dissolved,
take from the fire. When cool enough, beat into it the four beaten
whites of eggs, turn into the mold and set in a cold place to
stiffen, first placing pieces of sponge cake all around the
mold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BURNT ALMOND CHARLOTTE.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of sweet almonds, blanched and chopped fine, half a
box of gelatine soaked two hours in half a cupful of cold water;
when the gelatine is sufficiently soaked, put three tablespoonfuls
of sugar into a saucepan over the fire and stir until it becomes
liquid and looks dark; then add the chopped almonds to it and stir
two minutes more; turn it out on a platter and set aside to get
cool. After they become cool enough break them up in a mortar, put
them in a cup and a half of milk, and cook again for ten minutes.
Now beat together the yolks of two eggs with a cupful of sugar, and
add to the cooking mixture; add also the gelatine; stir until
smooth and well dissolved; take from the fire and set in a basin of
ice-water and beat it until it begins to thicken; then add to that
two quarts of whipped cream, and turn the whole carefully into
molds, set away on the ice to become firm. Sponge cake can be
placed around the mold or not, as desired.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHARLOTTE RUSSE, WITH PINEAPPLE.</b></p>
<p>Peel and cut a pineapple in slices, put the slices into a
stewpan with half a pound of fine white sugar, half an ounce of
isinglass, or of patent gelatine (which is better), and half a
teacupful of water; stew it until it is quite tender, then rub it
through a sieve, place it upon ice, and stir it well; when it is
upon the point of setting, add a pint of cream well whipped, mix it
well and pour it into a mold lined with sponge cake, or prepared in
any other way you prefer.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COUNTRY PLUM CHARLOTTE.</b></p>
<p>Stone a quart of ripe plums; first stew and then sweeten them.
Cut slices of bread and butter and lay them in the bottom and
around the sides of a large bowl or deep dish. Pour in the plums
boiling hot, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 365]</span><a name=
'Page_365' id="Page_365"></a>cover the bowl and set it away to cool
gradually. When quite cool, send it to the table and eat it with
cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VELVET CREAM, WITH STRAWBERRIES.</b></p>
<p>Dissolve half an ounce of gelatine in a gill of water; add to it
half a pint of light sherry, grated lemon peel and the juice of one
lemon and five ounces of sugar. Stir over the fire until the sugar
is thoroughly dissolved. Then strain and cool. Before it sets beat
into it a pint of cream; pour into molds and keep on ice until
wanted. Half fill the small molds with fine strawberries, pour the
mixture on top, and place on ice until wanted.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CORNSTARCH MERINGUE.</b></p>
<p>Heat a quart of milk until it boils, add four heaping
teaspoonfuls of cornstarch which has previously been dissolved in a
little cold milk. Stir constantly while boiling for fifteen
minutes. Remove from the fire, and gradually add while hot the
yolks of five eggs, beaten together with three-fourths of a cupful
of sugar, and flavored with lemon, vanilla or bitter almond. Bake
this mixture for fifteen minutes in a well-buttered pudding-dish or
until it begins to "set."</p>
<p>Make a meringue of the whites of five eggs, whipped stiff with a
half cupful of jelly, and spread evenly over the custard, without
removing the same farther than the edge of the oven.</p>
<p>Use currant jelly if vanilla is used in the custard, crab apple
for bitter almond and strawberry for lemon. Cover and bake for five
minutes, after which take off the lid and brown the meringue a very
little. Sift powdered sugar thickly over the top. To be eaten
cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WASHINGTON PIE.</b></p>
<p>This recipe is the same as "Boston Cream Pie" (adding half an
ounce of butter), which may be found under the head of PASTRY, PIES
AND TARTS. In summer time, it is a good plan to bake the pie the
day before wanted; then when cool, wrap around it a paper and place
it in the ice box so to have it get <i>very cold</i>; then serve it
with a dish of fresh strawberries or raspberries. A delicious
dessert.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 366]</span><a name='Page_366' id=

<p><b>CREAM PIE.</b></p>
<p>Make two cakes as for Washington pie, then take one cup of sweet
cream and three tablespoonfuls of white sugar. Beat with egg-beater
or fork till it is stiff enough to put on without running off and
flavor with vanilla. If you beat it after it is stiff it will come
to butter. Put between the cakes and on top.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DESSERT PUFFS.</b></p>
<p>Puffs for dessert are delicate and nice; take one pint of milk
and cream each, the whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth,
one heaping cupful of sifted flour, one scant cupful of powdered
sugar, add a little grated lemon peel and a little salt; beat these
all together till very light, bake in gem-pans, sift pulverized
sugar over them and eat with sauce flavored with lemon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH CAKE FOR DESSERT.</b></p>
<p>Bake three sheets of sponge cake, as for jelly cake; cut nice
ripe peaches in thin slices, or chop them; prepare cream by
whipping, sweetening and adding flavor of vanilla, if desired; put
layers of peaches between the sheets of cake; pour cream over each
layer and over the top. To be eaten soon after it is prepared.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT SHORT-CAKES.</b></p>
<p>For the recipes of strawberry, peach and other fruit
short-cakes, look under the head of BISCUITS, ROLLS AND MUFFINS.
They all make a very delicious dessert when served with a pitcher
of fresh sweet cream, when obtainable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALTED OR ROASTED ALMONDS.</b></p>
<p>Blanch half a pound of almonds. Put with them a tablespoonful of
melted butter and one of salt. Stir them till well mixed, then
spread them over a baking-pan and bake fifteen minutes, or till
crisp, stirring often. They must be bright yellow-brown when done.
They are a fashionable appetizer and should be placed in ornamental
dishes at the beginning of dinner, and are used by some in place of
olives, which, however, should also be on the table, or some fine
pickles may take their place.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 367]</span><a name='Page_367' id=

<p><b>ROAST CHESTNUTS.</b></p>
<p>Peel the raw chestnuts and scald them to remove the inner skin;
put them in a frying pan with a little butter and toss them about a
few moments; add a sprinkle of salt and a suspicion of cayenne.
Serve them after the cheese.</p>
<p>Peanuts may be blanched and roasted the same.</p>
<br>
<p><b>AFTER-DINNER CROUTONS.</b></p>
<p>These crispy <i>croutons</i> answer as a substitute for
hard-water crackers and are also relished by most people.</p>
<p>Cut sandwich bread into slices one-quarter of an inch thick; cut
each slice into four small triangles; dry them in the oven slowly
until they assume a delicate brownish tint, then serve either hot
or cold. A nice way to serve them is to spread a paste of part
butter and part rich creamy cheese, to which may be added a very
little minced parsley.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE FLOAT.</b></p>
<p>To make orange float, take one quart of water, the juice and
pulp of two lemons, one coffeecupful of sugar. When boiling hot,
add four tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. Let it boil fifteen minutes,
stirring all the time. When cold, pour it over four or five oranges
that have been sliced into a glass dish and over the top spread the
beaten whites of three eggs, sweetened and flavored with vanilla. A
nice dessert.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON TOAST.</b></p>
<p>This dessert can be made very conveniently without much
preparation.</p>
<p>Take the yolks of six eggs, beat them well and add three cupfuls
of sweet milk; take baker's bread, not too stale, and cut into
slices; dip them into the milk and eggs and lay the slices into a
spider, with sufficient melted butter, hot, to fry a delicate
brown. Take the whites of the six eggs and beat them to a froth,
adding a large cupful of white sugar; add the juice of two lemons,
heating well and adding two cupfuls of boiling water. Serve over
the toast as a sauce and you will find it a very delicious
dish.</p>

<p><b>SWEET OMELET. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>One tablespoonful of butter, two of sugar, one cupful of milk,
four eggs. Let the milk come to a boil. Beat the flour and butter
together; add to them gradually the boiling milk and cook eight
minutes; stirring often; beat the sugar and the yolks of the eggs
together; add to the cooked mixture and set away to cool. When
cool, beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and add to the
mixture. Bake in a buttered pudding-dish for twenty minutes in a
moderate oven. Serve <i>immediately</i> with creamy sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWEET OMELET. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Four eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a pinch of salt, half a
teaspoonful of vanilla extract, one cupful of whipped cream. Beat
the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and gradually beat the
flavoring and sugar into them. When well beaten add the yolks and,
lastly, the whipped cream. Have a dish holding about one quart
slightly buttered. Pour the mixture into this and bake just twelve
minutes. Serve the moment it is taken from the oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALAD OF MIXED FRUITS.</b></p>
<p>Put in the centre of a dish a pineapple properly pared, cored
and sliced, yet retaining as near as practicable its original
shape. Peel, quarter and remove the seeds from four sweet oranges;
arrange them in a border around the pineapple. Select four fine
bananas, peel and cut into slices lengthwise; arrange these
zigzag-fence fashion around the border of the dish. In the V-shaped
spaces around the dish put tiny mounds of grapes of mixed colors.
When complete, the dish should look very appetizing. To half a pint
of clear sugar syrup add half an ounce of good brandy, pour over
the fruit and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE COCOANUT SALAD.</b></p>
<p>Peel and slice a dozen oranges, grate a cocoanut and slice a
pineapple. Put alternate layers of each until the dish is full.
Then pour over them sweetened wine. Served with small cakes.</p>
<p>When oranges are served whole, they should be peeled and
prettily arranged in a fruit dish. A small knife is best for this
purpose. Break the skin from the stem into six or eight even parts,
peel each section down half way, and tuck the point in next to the
orange.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 369]</span><a name='Page_369' id=
"Page_369"></a>
<p><b>CRYSTALLIZED FRUIT.</b></p>
<p>Pick out the finest of any kind of fruit, leave on their stalks,
beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, lay the fruit in
the beaten egg with the stalks upward, drain them and beat the part
that drips off again; select them out, one by one and dip them into
a cup of finely powdered sugar; cover a pan with a sheet of fine
paper, place the fruit inside of it, and put it in an oven that is
cooling; when the icing on the fruit becomes firm, pile them on a
dish and set them in a cool place. For this purpose, oranges or
lemons should be carefully pared, and all the white inner skin
removed that is possible, to prevent bitterness; then cut either in
thin horizontal slices if lemons, or in quarters if oranges. For
cherries, strawberries, currants, etc., choose the largest and
finest, leaving stems out. Peaches should be pared and cut in
halves and sweet juicy pears may be treated in the same way, or
look nicely when pared, leaving on the stems and iced. Pineapples
should be cut in thin slices and these again divided into
quarters.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACHES AND CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Pare and slice the peaches just before sending to table. Cover
the glass dish containing them to exclude the air as much as
possible, as they soon change color. Do not sugar them in the
dish&mdash;they then become preserves, not fresh fruit. Pass the
powdered sugar and cream with them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SNOW PYRAMID.</b></p>
<p>Beat to a stiff foam the whites of half a dozen eggs, add a
small teacupful of currant jelly and whip all together again. Fill
half full of cream as many saucers as you have guests, dropping in
the centre of each saucer a tablespoonful of the beaten eggs and
jelly in the shape of a pyramid.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JELLY FRITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Make a batter of three eggs, a pint of milk and a pint bowl of
wheat flour or more, beat it light; put a tablespoonful of lard or
beef fat in a frying or omelet pan, add a saltspoonful of salt,
making it boiling hot, put in the batter by the large spoonful, not
too close; when one side is a delicate brown, turn the other; when
done, take them on to a dish with a d'oyley over it; put a
dessertspoonful of firm jelly or jam on each and serve. A very nice
dessert.</p>

<p><b>STEWED APPLES. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Take a dozen green tart apples, core and slice them, put into a
saucepan with just enough water to cover them, cover the saucepan
closely, and stew the apples until they are tender and clear; then
take them out, put them into a deep dish and cover them; add to the
juice in the saucepan a cupful of loaf sugar for every twelve
apples, and boil it half an hour, adding to the syrup a pinch of
mace and a dozen whole cloves just ten minutes before taking from
the fire; pour scalding hot over the apples and set them in a cold
place; eat ice cold with cream or boiled custard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED APPLES. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Apples cooked in the following way look very pretty on a
tea-table and are appreciated by the palate. Select firm round
greenings, pare neatly and cut in halves; place in a shallow
stewpan with sufficient boiling water to cover them and a cup of
sugar to every six apples. Each half should cook on the bottom of
the pan and be removed from the others so as not to injure its
shape. Stew slowly until the pieces are very tender; remove to a
glass dish carefully, boil the syrup a half hour longer, pour it
over the apples and eat cold. A few pieces of lemon boiled in the
syrup add to the flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED PEARS.</b></p>
<p>Pare and core the pears without dividing; place them in a pan
and fill up the orifice with brown sugar; add a little water and
let them bake until perfectly tender. Nice with sweet cream or
boiled custard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEWED PEARS.</b></p>
<p>Stewed pears with a thick syrup make a fine dessert dish
accompanied with cake.</p>
<p>Peel and cut them in halves, leaving the stems on and scoop out
the cores. Put them into a saucepan, placing them close together,
with the stems uppermost. Pour over sufficient water, a cup of
sugar, a few whole cloves and some sticks of cinnamon, a
tablespoonful of lemon juice. Cover the stewpan closely, to stew
gently till the fruit is done, which will depend on the quality of
the fruit. Then take out the fruit carefully and arrange it on a
dish for serving. Boil down the syrup <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
371]</span><a name='Page_371' id="Page_371"></a>until quite thick;
strain it and allow it to cool enough to set it; then pour it over
the fruit.</p>
<p>The juice could be colored by a few drops of liquid cochineal,
or a few slices of beets, while boiling. A teaspoonful of brandy
adds much to the flavor. Serve with cream or boiled custard.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED QUINCES.</b></p>
<p>Take ripe quinces, pare and quarter them, cut out the seeds;
then stew them in clear water until a straw will pierce them; put
into a baking dish with half a cupful of loaf sugar to every eight
quinces; pour over them the liquor in which they were boiled, cover
closely and bake in the oven one hour; then take out the quinces
and put them into a covered dish; return the syrup to the saucepan
and boil twenty minutes; then pour over the quinces and set them
away to cool.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOOSEBERRY FOOL.</b></p>
<p>Stew a quart of ripe gooseberries in just enough water to cover
them; when soft, rub them through a colander to remove the skins
and seeds; while hot stir into them a tablespoonful of melted
butter and a cupful of sugar. Beat the yolks of three eggs and add
that; whip all together until light. Fill a large glass fruit dish
and spread on the top the beaten whites mixed with three
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Apples or any tart fruit is nice made in
this manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MERINGUES OR KISSES.</b></p>
<p>A coffeecupful of fine white sugar, the whites of six eggs;
whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and with a wooden
spoon stir in <i>quickly</i> the pounded sugar; and have some
boards put in the oven thick enough to prevent the bottom of the
meringues from acquiring too much color. Cut some strips of paper
about two inches wide; place this paper on the board and drop a
tablespoonful at a time of the mixture on the paper, taking care to
let all the meringues be the same size. In dropping it from the
spoon, give the mixture the form of an egg and keep the meringues
about two inches apart from each other on the paper. Strew over
them some sifted sugar and bake in a moderate oven for half an
hour. As soon as they begin to color, remove them from the oven;
take each slip of paper by the two ends and turn it gently on the
table and with a small spoon take out the soft part of <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 372]</span><a name='Page_372' id="Page_372"></a>each
meringue. Spread some clean paper on the board, turn the meringues
upside down and put them into the oven to harden and brown on the
other side. When required for table, fill them with whipped cream,
flavored with liquor or vanilla and sweeten with pounded sugar.
Join two of the meringues together and pile them high in the dish.
To vary their appearance, finely chopped almonds or currants may be
strewn over them before the sugar is sprinkled over; and they may
be garnished with any bright-colored preserve. Great expedition is
necessary in making this sweet dish, as, if the meringues are not
put into the oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are mixed, the
former melts and the mixture would run on the paper instead of
keeping its egg-shape. The sweeter the meringues are made the
crisper will they be; but if there is not sufficient sugar mixed
with them, they will most likely be tough. They are sometimes
colored with cochineal; and if kept well-covered in a dry place,
will remain good for a month or six weeks.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JELLY KISSES.</b></p>
<p>Kisses, to be served for dessert at a large dinner, with other
suitable confectionery, may be varied in this way: Having made the
kisses, heap them in the shape of half an egg, placed upon stiff
letter paper lining the bottom of a thick baking pan; put them in a
moderate oven until the outside is a little hardened; then take one
off carefully, take out the soft inside with the handle of a spoon,
and put it back with the mixture, to make more; then lay the shell
down. Take another and prepare it likewise; fill the shells with
currant jelly or jam; join two together, cementing them with some
of the mixture; so continue until you have enough. Make kisses,
cocoanut drops, and such like, the day before they are wanted.</p>
<p>This recipe will make a fair-sized cake basket full. It adds
much to their beauty when served up to tint half of them pale pink,
then unite white and pink. Serve on a high glass dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT MACAROONS.</b></p>
<p>Make a "kiss" mixture, add to it the white meat, grated, and
finish as directed for KISSES.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALMOND MACAROONS.</b></p>
<p>Half a pound of sweet almonds, a coffeecupful of white sugar,
the whites of two eggs; blanch the almonds and pound them to a
paste; <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 373]</span><a name='Page_373' id=
"Page_373"></a>add to them the sugar and the beaten whites of eggs;
work the whole together with the back of a spoon, then roll the
mixture in your hands in balls about the size of a nutmeg, dust
sugar over the top, lay them on a sheet of paper at least an inch
apart. Bake in a cool oven a light brown.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE MACAROONS.</b></p>
<p>Put three ounces of plain chocolate in a pan and melt on a slow
fire; then work it to a thick paste with one pound of powdered
sugar and the whites of three eggs; roll the mixture down to the
thickness of about one-quarter of an inch; cut it in small, round
pieces with a paste-cutter, either plain or scalloped; butter a pan
slightly, and dust it with flour and sugar in equal quantities;
place in it the pieces of paste or mixture, and bake in a hot but
not too quick oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON JELLY. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Wash and prepare four calf's feet, place them in four quarts of
water, and let them simmer gently five hours. At the expiration of
this time take them out and pour the liquid into a vessel to cool;
there should be nearly a quart. When cold, remove every particle of
fat, replace the jelly into the preserving-kettle, and add one
pound of loaf sugar, the rind and juice of two lemons; when the
sugar has dissolved, beat two eggs with their shells in one gill of
water, which pour into the kettle and boil five minutes, or until
perfectly clear; then add one gill of Madeira wine and strain
through a flannel bag into any form you like.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON JELLY. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>To a package of gelatine add a pint of cold water, the juice of
four lemons and the rind of one; let it stand one hour, then add
one pint of boiling water, a pinch of cinnamon, three cups of
sugar; let it all come to a boil; strain through a napkin into
molds, set away to get cold. Nice poured over sliced bananas and
oranges.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WINE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>One package of gelatine, one cupful of cold water soaked
together two hours; add to this three cupfuls of sugar, the juice
of three lemons and the grated rind of one. Now pour over this a
quart of boiling water and stir until dissolved, then add a pint of
sherry wine. Strain <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 374]</span><a name=
'Page_374' id="Page_374"></a>through a napkin, turn into molds
dipped in cold water and place in the ice box for several
hours.</p>
<p>One good way to mold this jelly is to pour some of it into the
mold, harden it a little, put in a layer of strawberries or
raspberries, or any fresh fruit in season, pour in jelly to set
them; after they have set, another layer of jelly, then another of
berries, and so fill each mold, alternating with jelly and
berries.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CIDER JELLY.</b></p>
<p>This can be made the same, by substituting clear, sweet cider in
place of the wine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Orange jelly is a great delicacy and not expensive. To make a
large dish, get six oranges, two lemons, a two-ounce package of
gelatine. Put the gelatine to soak in a pint of water, squeeze the
orange juice into a bowl, also the lemon juice, and grate one of
the lemon skins in with it. Put about two cupfuls of sugar with the
gelatine, then stir in the orange juice, and pour over all three
pints of boiling water, stirring constantly. When the gelatine is
entirely dissolved, strain through a napkin into molds or bowls wet
with cold water, and set aside to harden. In three or four hours it
will be ready for use and will last several days.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VARIEGATED JELLY.</b></p>
<p>After dividing a box of Cox's gelatine into halves, put each
half into a bowl with half a cupful of cold water. Put
three-quarters of an ounce or six sheets of pink gelatine into a
third bowl containing three-fourths of a cupful of cold water.
Cover the bowls to keep out the dust and set them away for two
hours. At the end of that time, add a pint of boiling water, a
cupful of sugar, half a pint of wine, and the juice of lemon to the
pink gelatine, and, after stirring till the gelatine is dissolved,
strain the liquid through a napkin. Treat one of the other portions
of the gelatine in the same way. Beat together the yolks of four
eggs and half a cupful of sugar, and, after adding this mixture to
the third portion of gelatine, stir the new mixture into a pint and
a third of boiling milk, contained in a double boiler. Stir on the
fire for three minutes, then strain through a fine sieve, and
flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Place in a deep pan
two molds, each holding about three pints, and surround them with
ice and water. Pour <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 375]</span><a name=
'Page_375' id="Page_375"></a>into these molds, in equal parts, the
wine jelly which was made with the clear gelatine, and set it away
to harden. When it has become set, pour in the pink gelatine, which
should have been set away in a place not cold enough to make it
harden. After it has been transferred and has become hard, pour
into the molds the mixture of eggs, sugar and gelatine, which
should be in a liquid state. Set the molds in an ice chest for
three or four hours. At serving time, dip them into tepid water to
loosen the contents, and gently turn the jelly out upon flat
dishes.</p>
<p>The clear jelly may be made first and poured into molds, then
the pink jelly and finally the egg jelly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Strawberries, pounded sugar; to every pint of juice allow half a
package of Cox's gelatine.</p>
<p>Pick the strawberries, put them into a pan, squeeze them well
with a wooden spoon, add sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten them
nicely, and let them remain for one hour that the juice may be
extracted; then add half a pint of water to every pint of juice.
Strain the strawberry juice and water through a napkin; measure it
and to every pint allow half a package of Cox's gelatine dissolved
in a teacupful of water. Mix this with the juice, put the jelly
into a mold and set the mold on ice. A little lemon juice added to
the strawberry juice improves the flavor of the jelly, if the fruit
is very ripe; but it must be well strained before it is put with
the other ingredients, or it will make the jelly muddy. Delicious
and beautiful.</p>

<h2><b>ICE CREAM AND ICES</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>ICE-CREAM.</b></p>
<p>One pint of milk, the yolks of two eggs, six ounces of sugar and
one tablespoonful of cornstarch. Scald but do not boil. Then put
the whites of the two eggs into a pint of cream; whip it. Mix the
milk and cream, flavor and freeze. One teaspoonful of vanilla or
lemon is generally sufficient.</p>
<p>The quantity, of course, can be increased to any amount desired,
so long as the relative proportions of the different ingredients
are observed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PURE ICE-CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Genuine ice-cream is made of the pure sweet cream in this
proportion: Two quarts of cream, one pound of sugar; beat up,
flavor and freeze.</p>
<p>For family use, select one of the new patent freezers, as being
more rapid and less laborious for small quantities than the old
style turned entirely by hand. All conditions being perfect, those
with crank and revolving dashers effect freezing in eight to
fifteen minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT ICE-CREAM.</b></p>
<p><i>Ingredients.</i>&mdash;To every pint of fruit juice allow one
pint of cream; sugar to taste.</p>
<p>Let the fruit be well ripened; pick it off the stalks and put it
into a large earthen pan. Stir it about with a wooden spoon,
breaking it until it is well mashed; then, with the back of the
spoon, rub it through a hair-sieve. Sweeten it nicely with pounded
sugar; whip the cream for a few minutes, add it to the fruit, and
whisk the whole again for another five minutes. Put the mixture
into the freezer and freeze. Raspberry, strawberry, currant, and
all fruit ice-creams are made in the same manner. A little powdered
sugar sprinkled over the fruit before it is mashed assists to
extract the juice. In winter, when fresh <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
377]</span><a name='Page_377' id="Page_377"></a>fruit is not
obtainable, a little jam may be substituted for it; it should be
melted and worked through a sieve before being added to the whipped
cream; and if the color should not be good, a little prepared
cochineal may be put in to improve its appearance. In making berry
flavoring for ice-cream, the milk should never be heated; the juice
of the berries added to <i>cold</i> cream, or fresh rich milk,
mixed with <i>cold</i> cream, the juice put in just before
freezing, or when partly frozen.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM. No. 1. (Very fine.)</b></p>
<p>Add four ounces of grated chocolate to a cupful of sweet milk,
then mix it thoroughly to a quart of thick sweet cream; no
flavoring is required but vanilla. Sweeten with a cupful of sugar;
beat again and freeze.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Beat two eggs very light and cream them with two cupfuls of
sugar. Scald a pint of milk and turn on by degrees, mixing well
with the sugar and eggs. Stir in this half a cupful of grated
chocolate; return to the fire and heat until it thickens, stirring
briskly; take off and set aside to cool. When thoroughly cold,
freeze.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT ICE-CREAM.</b></p>
<p>One quart of cream, one pint of milk, three eggs, one cupful and
a half of sugar and one of prepared cocoanut, the rind and juice of
a lemon. Beat together the eggs and grated lemon rind and put with
the milk in the double boiler. Stir until the mixture begins to
thicken. Add the cocoanut and put away to cool. When cool add the
sugar, lemon juice and cream. Freeze.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUSTARD ICE-CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Sweeten one quart of cream or rich milk with half a pound of
sugar and flavor to taste; put it over the fire in a farina-kettle;
as soon as it begins to boil, stir into it a tablespoonful of
cornstarch or rice flour which has been previously mixed smooth
with a little milk; after it has boiled a few minutes, take it off
the fire and stir in very gradually six eggs which have been beaten
until thick; when quite cold, freeze it as ice-cream.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 378]</span><a name='Page_378' id=
"Page_378"></a>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY ICE-CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Mix a cupful of sugar with a quart of ripe strawberries, let
them stand half a day, then mash and strain them through a coarse
towel, then add to the juice a full cupful of sugar and when
dissolved, beat in a quart of fresh thick cream. Raspberries,
pineapple and other fruits made the same.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Make a rich, boiled custard; flavor with wine and vanilla; pour
it into a freezer. When half frozen, add pounded almonds, chopped
citron and brandy, peaches or chopped raisins. Have the freezer
half full of custard and fill up with the fruit. Mix well and
freeze again. Almost any kind of fruits that are preferred may be
substituted for the above.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TUTTI FRUTTI ICE-CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Take two quarts of the richest cream and add to it one pound of
pulverized sugar and four whole eggs; mix well together; place on
the fire, stirring constantly, and just bring to boiling point; now
remove immediately and continue to stir until nearly cold; flavor
with a tablespoonful of extract of vanilla; place in freezer and,
when half frozen, mix thoroughly into it one pound of preserved
fruits, in equal parts of peaches, apricots, gages, cherries,
pineapples, etc.; all of these fruits are to be cut up into small
pieces and mixed well with frozen cream. If you desire to
<i>mold</i> this ice sprinkle it with a little carmine, dissolved
in a teaspoonful of water, with two drops of spirits of ammonia;
mix in this color, so that it will be streaky or in veins like
marble.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ICE-CREAM WITHOUT A FREEZER.</b></p>
<p>Beat the yolks of eight eggs very light, and add thereto four
cupfuls of sugar, and stir well. Add to this, little by little, one
quart of rich milk that has been heated almost to boiling, beating
all the while; then put in the whites of eight eggs beaten to a
stiff froth. Then boil the mixture in a pail set inside another
containing hot water. Boil about fifteen minutes or until it is as
thick as a boiled custard, stirring steadily meanwhile. Pour into a
bowl to cool. When quite cold, beat into it three pints of rich
sweet cream and five teaspoonfuls of vanilla, or such other
flavoring as you prefer. Put it into a pail having a close-fitting
cover and pack in pounded ice and salt,&mdash;<i>rock salt</i>, not
the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 379]</span><a name='Page_379' id=
"Page_379"></a>common kind,&mdash;about three-fourths ice and
one-forth salt. When packed, before putting the ice on top of the
cover, beat the custard as you would batter, for five minutes
steady; then put on the cover and put the ice and salt over it, and
cover the whole with a thick mat, blanket or carpet and let it
stand for an hour. Then carefully uncover and scrape from the
bottom and sides of the pail the thick coating of frozen custard,
making every particle clear, and beat again very hard, until the
custard is a smooth, half-congealed paste. Do this thoroughly. Put
on the cover, ice, salt and blanket, and leave it for five or six
hours, replenishing the ice and salt if necessary.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Common Sense in the Household.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>FROZEN PEACHES.</b></p>
<p>One can or twelve large peaches, two coffeecupfuls of sugar, one
pint of water and the whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth;
break the peaches rather fine and stir all the ingredients
together; freeze the whole into form.</p>
<p>Frozen fruit of any kind can be made the same way; the fruit
should be mashed to a smooth pulp, but not thinned too much. In
freezing, care should be taken to prevent its getting lumpy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FROZEN FRUITS.</b></p>
<p>The above recipe, increasing the quantity of peaches,
raspberries or whatever fruit you may use, and adding a small
amount of rich cream, make fine frozen fruits. In freezing, you
must be especially careful to prevent its getting lumpy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON ICE.</b></p>
<p>The juice of six lemons and the grated rind of three, a large
sweet orange, juice and rind; squeeze out all the juice and steep
it in the rind of orange and lemons a couple of hours; then squeeze
and strain through a towel, add a pint of water and two cupfuls of
sugar. Stir until dissolved, turn into a freezer, then proceed as
for ice-cream, letting it stand longer, two or three hours.</p>
<p>When fruit jellies are used, gently heat the water sufficiently
to melt them; then cool and freeze. Other flavors may be made in
this manner, varying the flavoring to taste.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 380]</span><a name='Page_380' id=

<p><b>PINEAPPLE SHERBET.</b></p>
<p>Grate two pineapples and mix with two quarts of water and a pint
of sugar; add the juice of two lemons and the beaten whites of four
eggs. Place in a freezer and freeze.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RASPBERRY SHERBET.</b></p>
<p>Two quarts of raspberries, one cupful of sugar, one pint and a
half of water, the juice of a large lemon, one tablespoonful of
gelatine. Mash the berries and sugar together and let them stand
two hours. Soak the gelatine in cold water to cover. Add one pint
of the water to the berries and strain. Dissolve the gelatine in
half a pint of boiling water, add this to the strained mixture and
freeze.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE-WATER ICE.</b></p>
<p>Add a tablespoonful of gelatine to one gill of water; let it
stand twenty minutes and add half a pint of boiling water; stir
until dissolved and add four ounces of powdered sugar, the strained
juice of six oranges and cold water enough to make a full quart in
all. Stir until the sugar is dissolved; pour into the freezing can
and freeze. (See LEMON ICE.)</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALMOND ICE.</b></p>
<p>Two pints of milk, eight ounces of cream, two ounces of
orange-flower water, eight ounces of sweet almonds, four ounces of
bitter almonds; pound all in a marble mortar, pouring in from time
to time a few drops of water; when thoroughly pounded add the
orange-flower water and half of the milk; pass this, tightly
squeezed, through a cloth; boil the rest of the milk with the cream
and keep stirring it with a wooden spoon; as soon as it is thick
enough, pour in the almond milk; give it one boiling, take it off
and let it cool in a bowl or pitcher before pouring it into the
mold for freezing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRANT ICE.</b></p>
<p>A refreshing ice is made of currants or raspberries, or equal
portions of each. Squeeze enough fruit in a jelly-bag to make a
pint of juice; add a pint each of the water and sugar; pour the
whole, boiling hot, onto whites of three eggs, beaten to a stiff
froth, and whip the mixture thoroughly. When cool, freeze in the
usual manner. Part red raspberry juice is a much finer flavor.</p>
<p>Any juicy fruit may be prepared in this manner.</p>

<a name='DUMPLINGS_AND_PUDDINGS' id="DUMPLINGS_AND_PUDDINGS"></a>
<h2><b>DUMPLINGS AND PUDDINGS</b></h2>
<br>
<p>It depends as much upon the judgment of the cook as on the
materials used to make a good pudding. Everything should be the
best in the way of materials, and a proper attention to the rules,
with some practice, will ensure success.</p>
<p>Puddings are either boiled, baked or steamed; if boiled, the
materials should be well worked together, put into a thick cloth
bag, previously dipped in hot water, wringing it slightly and
dredging the inside <i>thickly</i> with flour; tie it firmly,
allowing room for it to swell; drop it into a kettle of
<i>boiling</i> water, with a small plate or saucer in the bottom to
keep it from sticking to the kettle. It should not cease boiling
one moment from the time it is put in until taken out, and the pot
must be tightly covered, and the cover not removed except when
necessary to add water from the <i>boiling</i> tea-kettle when the
water is getting low. When done, dip immediately in cold water and
turn out. This should be done just before placing on the table.</p>
<p>Or butter a tin pudding-mold or an earthen bowl; close it tight
so that water cannot penetrate; drop it into boiling water and boil
steadily the required time. If a bowl is used it should be well
buttered and not quite filled with the pudding, allowing room for
it to swell; then a cloth wet in hot water, slightly wringing it,
then floured on the inner side, and tied over the bowl, meeting
under the bottom.</p>
<p>To steam a pudding, put it into a tin pan or earthen dish; tie a
cloth over the top, first dredging it in flour, and set it in a
steamer. Cover the steamer closely; allow a little longer time than
you do for boiling.</p>
<p>Molds or basins for baking, steaming or boiling should be well
buttered before the mixture is put into them. Allow a little longer
time for steaming than for boiling.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 382]</span><a name='Page_382' id=
"Page_382"></a>
<p>Dumplings boiled the same way, put into little separate
cloths.</p>
<p>Batter puddings should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps. To
ensure this, first mix the flour with a very small portion of milk,
the yolks of the eggs and the sugar thoroughly beaten together, and
added to this; then add the remainder of the milk by degrees, then
the seasoning, then the beaten whites of eggs last. Much success in
making this kind of pudding depends upon a strict observance of
this rule; for, although the materials may be good, if the eggs are
put into the milk before they are mixed with the flour, there will
be a custard at the top and a soft dough at the bottom of your
dish.</p>
<p>All sweet puddings require a <i>little</i> salt to prevent
insipidity and to draw out the flavor of the several ingredients,
but a grain too much will spoil any pudding.</p>
<p>In puddings where wine, brandy, cider, lemon juice or any acid
is used, it should be stirred in last and gradually, or it is apt
to curdle the milk or eggs.</p>
<p>In making <i>custard puddings</i> (puddings made with eggs and
milk), the yolks of the eggs and sugar should be thoroughly beaten
together before any of the milk or seasoning is added, and the
beaten whites of eggs last.</p>
<p>In making puddings of bread, rice, sago, tapioca, etc., the eggs
should be beaten very light, and mixed with a portion of the milk,
before adding them to the other ingredients. If the eggs are mixed
with the milk, without having been thus beaten, the milk will be
absorbed by the bread, rice, sago, tapioca, etc., without rendering
them light.</p>
<p>The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of much importance,
as one bad article will taint the whole mixture.</p>
<p>When the <i>freshness</i> of eggs is <i>doubtful</i>, break each
one separately in a cup before mixing them all together. Should
there be a bad one amongst them, it can be thrown away; whereas, if
mixed with the good ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled. The
yolks and whites beaten separately make the articles they are put
into much lighter.</p>
<p>Raisins and dried fruit for puddings should be carefully picked
and, in many cases, stoned. Currants should be well washed, pressed
in a cloth and placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly
dry; they should be then picked carefully over, and <i>every piece
of grit or stone</i> removed from amongst them. To plump them, some
cooks pour boiling water over them and then dry them before the
fire.</p>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 383]</span><a name='Page_383' id=
"Page_383"></a>
<p>Many baked pudding recipes are quite as good boiled. As a safe
rule boil the pudding <i>twice as long</i> as you would bake it;
and remember that a boiling pudding should never be touched after
it is once put on the stove; a jar of the kettle destroys the
lightness of the pudding. If the water boils down and more must be
added, it must be done so carefully that the mold will not hit the
side of the kettle, and it must not be allowed to stop boiling for
an instant.</p>
<p>Batter should never-stick to the knife when it is sent to the
table; it will do this both when less than sufficient number of
eggs is mixed with it and when it is not cooked enough; about four
eggs to the half pound of flour will make it firm enough to cut
smoothly.</p>
<p>When baked or boiled puddings are sufficiently solid, turn them
out of the dish they were baked in, bottom uppermost and strew over
them finely sifted sugar.</p>
<p>When pastry or baked puddings are not done through, and yet the
outside is sufficiently brown, cover them over with a piece of
white paper until thoroughly cooked; this prevents them from
getting burnt.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLEAN CURRANTS.</b></p>
<p>Put them in a sieve or colander and sprinkle them thickly with
flour; rub them well until they are separated, and the flour, grit
and fine stems have passed through the strainer. Place the strainer
and currants in a pan of water and wash thoroughly; then lift the
strainer and currants together, and change the water until it is
clear. Dry the currants between clean towels. It hardens them to
dry in an oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CHOP SUET.</b></p>
<p>Break or cut in small pieces, sprinkle with sifted flour, and
chop in a cold place to keep it from becoming sticky and soft.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO STONE RAISINS.</b></p>
<p>Put them in a dish and pour <i>boiling</i> water over them;
cover and let them remain in it ten minutes; it will soften so that
by rubbing each raisin between the thumb and finger, the seeds will
come out clean; then they are ready for cutting or chopping if
required.</p>

<p><b>APPLE DUMPLINGS.</b></p>
<p>Make a rich biscuit dough, the same as soda or baking-powder
biscuit, only adding a little more shortening. Take a piece of
dough out on the molding-board, roll out almost as thin as pie
crust; then cut into square pieces large enough to cover an apple.
Put into the middle of each piece two apple halves that have been
pared and cored; sprinkle on a spoonful of sugar and a pinch of
ground cinnamon, turn the ends of the dough over the apple and lap
them tight. Lay the dumplings in a dripping-pan buttered, the
smooth side upward. When the pans are filled, put a small piece of
butter on top of each, sprinkle over a large handful of sugar, turn
in a cupful of boiling water, then place in a moderate oven for
three-quarters of an hour. Baste with the liquor once while baking.
Serve with pudding-sauce or cream and sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED APPLE DUMPLINGS.</b></p>
<p>The same recipe as the above, with the exception that they are
put into a small coarse cloth well floured after being dipped in
hot water. Each cloth to be tied securely, but leaving room enough
for the dumpling to swell. Put them in a pot of boiling water and
boil three-quarters of an hour. Serve with sweet sauce. Peaches and
other fruits used in the same manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED RICE DUMPLINGS, CUSTARD SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Boil half a pound of rice, drain and mash it moderately fine.
Add to it two ounces of butter, three ounces of sugar, half a
saltspoonful of mixed ground spice, salt and the yolks of two eggs.
Moisten a trifle with a tablespoonful or two of cream. With floured
hands shape the mixture into balls, and tie them in floured pudding
cloths. Steam or boil forty minutes and send to table with a
custard sauce made as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mix together four ounces of sugar and two ounces of butter
(slightly warmed). Beat together the yolks of two eggs and a gill
of cream; mix and pour the sauce in a double saucepan; set this in
a pan of hot water and whisk thoroughly three minutes. Set the
saucepan in cold water and whisk until the sauce is cooled.</p>

<p><b>SUET DUMPLINGS. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>One pint bowl of fine bread crumbs, one-half cupful of beef suet
chopped fine, the whites and yolks of four eggs beaten separately
and very light, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar sifted into half
a cupful of flour, half a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little
water, and a teaspoonful of salt. Wet it all together with milk
enough to make a stiff paste. Flour your hands and make into balls.
Tie up in separate cloths that have been wrung out in hot water and
floured inside; leave room, when tying, for them to swell. Drop
them into <i>boiling</i> water and boil about three-quarters of an
hour. Serve <i>hot</i>, with wine sauce, or syrup and butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUET DUMPLINGS. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of suet chopped fine, one cupful of grated English
muffins or bread, one cupful of flour, half a teaspoonful of baking
powder, half a cupful of sugar, two eggs, one pint of milk, a large
pinch of salt. Sift together powder and flour, add the beaten eggs,
grated muffins, sugar, suet and milk; form into smooth batter,
which drop by tablespoonfuls into a pint of boiling milk, three or
four at a time; when done, dish and pour over the milk they were
boiled in. A Danish dish; very good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVE DUMPLINGS.</b></p>
<p>Preserved peaches, plums, quinces, cherries or any other
sweetmeat; make a light crust, and roll a small piece of moderate
thickness and fill with the fruit in quantity to make the size of a

<p><b>ALMOND PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Turn boiling water on to three-fourths of a pound of sweet
almonds, let it remain until the skin comes off easily; rub with a
dry cloth; when dry, pound fine with one large spoonful of
rose-water; beat six eggs to a stiff froth with three spoonfuls of
fine white sugar; mix with one quart of milk, three spoonfuls of
pounded crackers, four ounces of melted butter, and the same of
citron cut into bits; add almonds, stir altogether and bake in a
small pudding-dish with a lining and rim of pastry. This pudding is
best when cold. It will bake in half an hour in a quick oven.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE PUDDING, BAKED.</b></p>
<p>Stir two tablespoonfuls of butter and half a cupful of sugar to
a cream; stir into this the yolks of four eggs, well beaten, the
juice and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 387]</span><a name='Page_387'

half a wine-glassful of wine, nutmeg, butter and sugar for sauce.
Pare, core and mince the apples and mix with the bread crumbs,
nutmeg, grated sugar, currants; the juice of the lemon and half the
rind grated. Beat the eggs well, moisten the mixture with these and
beat all together, adding the wine last; put the pudding in a
buttered mold, tie it down with a cloth; boil one hour and a half
and serve with sweet sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BIRDS' NEST PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Core and peel eight apples, put in a dish, fill the places from
which the cores have been taken with sugar and a little grated
nutmeg; cover and bake. Beat the yolks of four eggs light, add two
teacupfuls of flour, with three even teaspoonfuls of baking powder
sifted with it, one pint of milk with a teaspoonful of salt; then
add the whites of the eggs well beaten, pour over the apples and
bake one hour in a moderate oven. Serve with sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Butter the sides and bottom of a deep pudding-dish, then butter
thin slices of bread, sprinkle thickly with sugar, a little
cinnamon, chopped apple, or any fruit you prefer between each
slice, until your dish is full. Beat up two eggs, add a
tablespoonful of sifted flour; stir with the three cupfuls of milk
and a little salt; pour over this the bread, let it stand one hour
and then bake slowly, with a cover on, three-quarters of an hour;
then take the cover off and brown. Serve with wine and lemon
sauce.</p>
<p>Pie-plant, cut up in small pieces with plenty of sugar, is fine
made in this manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Place a layer of stale bread, rolled fine, in the bottom of a
pudding-dish, then a layer of any kind of fruit; sprinkle on a
little sugar, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 388]</span><a name=
'Page_388' id="Page_388"></a>then another layer of bread crumbs and
of fruit; and so on until the dish is full, the top layer being
crumbs. Make a custard as for pies, add a pint of milk and mix.
Pour it over the top of the pudding and bake until the fruit is
cooked.</p>
<p>Stale cake, crumbed fine, in place of bread, is an
improvement.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD BERRY PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Take rather stale bread&mdash;baker's bread or light
home-made&mdash;cut in thin slices and spread with butter. Add a
very little water and a little sugar to one quart or more of
huckleberries and blackberries, or the former alone. Stew a few
minutes until juicy; put a layer of buttered bread in your buttered
pudding-dish, then a layer of stewed berries while hot and so on
until full; lastly, a covering of stewed berries. It may be
improved with a rather soft frosting over the top. To be eaten cold
with thick cream and sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE TAPIOCA PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Put one teacupful of tapioca and one teaspoonful of salt into
one pint and a half of water, and let it stand several hours where
it will be quite warm, but not cook; peel six tart apples, take out
the cores, fill them with sugar, in which is grated a little nutmeg
and lemon peel, and put them in a pudding-dish; over these pour the
tapioca, first mixing with it one teaspoonful of melted butter and
a cupful of cold milk, and half a cupful of sugar; bake one hour;
eat with sauce.</p>
<p>When fresh fruits are in season, this pudding is exceedingly
nice, with damsons, plums, red currants, gooseberries or apples;
when made with these, the pudding must be thickly sprinkled over
with sifted sugar.</p>
<p>Canned or fresh peaches may be used in place of apples in the
same manner, moistening the tapioca with the juice of the canned
peaches in place of the cold milk. Very nice when quite cool to
serve with sugar and cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE AND BROWN-BREAD PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Take a pint of brown bread crumbs, a pint bowl of chopped
apples, mix; add two-thirds of a cupful of finely-chopped suet, a

teaspoonful of cinnamon and one of nutmeg grated, half a cupful of
sugar and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a
little hot water. Beat up four eggs very light and add last. Turn

together the following ingredients: One cupful of finely-chopped
beef suet, two cupfuls of fine bread crumbs, one cupful of
molasses, one of chopped raisins, one of well-washed currants, one
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful each of cloves, cinnamon,
allspice and carbonate of soda, one cupful of milk and flour enough
to make a stiff batter. Put into a well-greased pudding-mold, or a
three-quart pail and cover closely. Set this pail into a larger
kettle, close covered, and half full of boiling water, adding
boiling water as it boils away. Steam not less than four hours.
This pudding is sure to be a success, and is quite rich for one
containing neither eggs nor butter. One-half of the above amount is
more than eight persons would be able to eat, but it is equally
good some days later, steamed again for an hour, if kept closely
covered meantime. Serve with wine sauce or common sweet sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CABINET PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Butter well the inside of a pudding-mold. Have ready a cupful of
chopped citron, raisins and currants. Sprinkle some of this fruit
on the bottom of the mold, then slices of stale sponge cake; shake
over this some spices, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, then fruit
again and cake, until the mold is nearly full. Make a custard of a
quart of milk, four eggs, a pinch of salt, two tablespoonfuls of
melted butter; pour this over the cake without cooking it; let it
stand and soak one hour; then steam one hour and a half. Serve with
wine sauce or a custard. Seasoned with wine.</p>

<p><b>BAKED CRANBERRY PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Pour boiling water on a pint of bread crumbs; melt a
tablespoonful of butter and stir in. When the bread is softened,
add two eggs and beat thoroughly with the bread. Then put in a pint

kinds can be used instead of cranberries. Slices of peaches put in
layers are delicious. Serve with sweet sugar sauce.</p>

sufficient milk to make the pudding of the consistency of thick
batter; put it into a well-buttered mold and boil for three and a
half hours; turn it out, strew sifted sugar over and serve warm

an hour; then remove it from the oven and place it to cool. Beat
the whites of the eggs with three tablespoonfuls of powdered white
sugar till they are a mass of froth; spread the pudding with either

be sure and keep the whites of the eggs on ice until ready for use
and beat them in the coolest place you can find, as it will make a
much richer frosting.</p>
<p>The small white sago called pearl is the best. The large brown
kind has an earthy taste. It should always be kept in a covered jar
or box.</p>

quart of berries, sugar and the rest of the tapioca. Fill the dish
with water, which should cover the tapioca about a quarter of an
inch. Bake in a moderately hot oven until it looks clear. Eat cold
with cream or Custard. If not sweet enough, add more sugar at
table; and in baking, if it seems too dry, more water is

gooseberries and three ounces of sugar; after having made your
paste, take half the fruit and lay it at the bottom of your basin;
then add half your sugar, then put the remainder of the
gooseberries in and the remainder of the sugar; on that, draw your
paste to the centre, join the edges well together, put the cloth
over the whole, tying it at the bottom, and boil in plenty of
water. Fruit puddings of this kind, such as apples and rhubarb,
should be done in this manner.</p>

turn out on a dish, or let it remain in the basin and serve with
sugar over.</p>
<p>A thin cover of the paste may be rolled round and put over the

<p>This pudding is very fine made with Boston crackers split open
and placed in layers with stewed peaches.</p>

<p><b>BOILED CURRANT PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Five cupfuls of sifted flour in which two teaspoonfuls of baking
powder have been sifted, one-half a cupful of chopped suet, half a
pound of currants, milk, a pinch of salt. Wash the currants, dry
them thoroughly and pick away any stalks or grit; chop the suet
finely; mix all the ingredients together and moisten with
sufficient milk to make the pudding into a stiff batter; tie it up
in a floured cloth, put it into boiling water and boil for three
hours and a half. Serve with jelly sauce made very sweet.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TRANSPARENT PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>A small cupful of fresh butter warmed, but not melted, one
cupful of sifted sugar creamed with the butter, a teaspoonful of
nutmeg, grated, eight eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately.
Beat the butter and sugar light and then add the nutmeg and the
beaten eggs, which should be stirred in gradually; flavor with
vanilla, almond, peach or rose-water; stir <i>hard</i>; butter a
deep dish, line with puff paste and bake half an hour. Then make a
meringue for the top and brown. Serve cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWEET-POTATO PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>To a large sweet potato, weighing two pounds, allow half a pound
of sugar, half a pound of butter, one gill of sweet cream, one gill
of strong wine or brandy, one grated nutmeg, a little lemon peel
and four eggs. Boil the potato until thoroughly done, mash up fine,
and while hot add the sugar and butter. Set aside to cool while you
beat the eggs light and add the seasoning last. Line tin plates
with puff paste, and pour in the mixture, bake in a moderate but
regularly heated oven. When the puddings are drawn from the fire,
cover the top with thinly-sliced bits of preserved citron or quince
marmalade. Strew the top thickly with granulated white sugar and
serve, with the addition of a glass of rich milk for each person at
table.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PINEAPPLE PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Butter a pudding-dish and line the bottom and sides with slices
of stale cake (sponge cake is best); pare and slice thin a large
pineapple, place in the dish first a layer of pineapple, then strew
with sugar, then more pineapple, and so on until all is used. Pour
over a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 411]</span><a name='Page_411' id=
"Page_411"></a>small teacupful of water and cover with slices of
cake which have been dipped in cold water; cover the whole with a
buttered plate and bake slowly for two hours.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE ROLEY POLEY.</b></p>
<p>Make a light dough the same as for apple dumplings, roll it out
into a long narrow sheet, about quarter of an inch thick. Spread
thickly over it peeled and sliced oranges, sprinkle it plentifully
with white sugar, scatter over all a teaspoonful or two of grated
orange peel, then roll it up. Fold the edges well together to keep
the juices from running out. Boil it in a floured cloth one hour
and a half. Serve it with lemon sauce. Fine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROLEY POLEY PUDDING. (Apple.)</b></p>
<p>Peel, core and slice sour apples; make a rich biscuit dough, or
raised biscuit dough may be used if rolled thinner; roll not quite
half an inch thick, lay the slices on the paste, roll up, tuck in
the ends, prick deeply with a fork, lay it in a steamer and steam
hard for an hour and three-quarters. Or wrap it in a pudding-cloth
well floured, tie the ends, baste up the sides, plunge into boiling
water and boil continually an hour and a half, perhaps more. Stoned
cherries, dried fruits, or any kind of berries, fresh or dried, may
be used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT PUFF PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Into one pint of flour stir two teaspoonfuls baking powder and a
little salt; then sift and stir the mixture into milk, until very
soft. Place well-greased cups in a steamer, put in each a spoonful
of the above batter, then add one of berries or steamed apples,
cover with another spoonful of batter and steam twenty minutes.
This pudding is delicious made with strawberries and eaten with a
sauce made of two eggs, half a cup butter, a cup of sugar beaten
thoroughly with a cup of boiling milk and one cup of
strawberries.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPONGE CAKE PUDDING. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Bake a common sponge cake in a flat-bottomed pudding-dish; when
ready to use, cut in six or eight pieces, split and spread with
butter and return them to the dish. Make a custard with four eggs
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 412]</span><a name='Page_412' id=
"Page_412"></a>to a quart of milk; flavor and sweeten to taste;
pour over the cake and bake one-half hour. The cake will swell and
fill the custard. Serve with or without sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPONGE CAKE PUDDING. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Butter pudding-mold; fill the mold with small sponge cakes or
slices of stale plain cake that have been soaked in a liquid made
by dissolving one-half pint of jelly in a pint of hot water. This
will be of as fine a flavor and much better for all than if the
cake had been soaked in wine. Make a sufficient quantity of custard
to fill the mold and leave as much more to be boiled in a dish by
itself. Set the mold, after being tightly covered, into a kettle
and boil one hour. Turn out of the mold and serve with some of the
other custard poured over it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRAHAM PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Mix well together one-half a coffeecupful of molasses,
one-quarter of a cupful of butter, one egg, one-half a cupful of
milk, one-half a teaspoonful of pure soda, one and one-half cupfuls
of good Graham flour, one small teacupful of raisins, spices to
taste. Steam four hours and serve with brandy or wine sauce, or any
sauce that may be preferred. This makes a showy as well as a light
and wholesome dessert, and has the merit of simplicity and
cheapness.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BANANA PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Cut sponge cake in-slices, and, in a glass dish, put alternately
a layer of cake and a layer of bananas sliced. Make a soft custard,
flavor with a little wine, and pour over it. Beat the whites of the
eggs to a stiff froth and heap over the whole.</p>
<p>Peaches cut up, left a few hours in sugar and then scalded, and
added when cold to thick boiled custard, made rather sweet, are a
delicious dessert.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRIED PEACH PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Boil one pint of milk and while hot turn it over a pint of
bread-crumbs. Stir into it a tablespoonful of butter, one pint of
dried peaches stewed soft. When all is cool, add two well-beaten
eggs, half a cupful of sugar and a pinch of salt; flavor to taste.
Put into a well-buttered pudding-dish and bake half an hour.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 413]</span><a name='Page_413' id=
"Page_413"></a>
<p><b>SUET PUDDING, PLAIN.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of chopped suet, one cupful of milk, two eggs beaten,
half a teaspoonful of salt and enough flour to make a stiff batter,
but thin enough to pour from a spoon. Put into a bowl, cover with a
cloth and boil three hours. The same, made a little thinner, with a
few raisins added and baked in a well-greased dish is excellent.
Two teaspoonfuls of baking powder in the flour improves this
pudding. Or if made with sour milk and soda it is equally as
good.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUET PLUM PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of suet chopped fine, one cupful of cooking molasses,
one cupful of milk, one cupful of raisins, three and one-half
cupfuls of flour, one egg, one teaspoonful of cloves, two of
cinnamon and one of nutmeg, a little salt, one teaspoonful of soda;
boil three hours in a pudding-mold set into a kettle of water; eat
with common sweet sauce. If sour milk is used in place of sweet,
the pudding will be much lighter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH COBBLER.</b></p>
<p>Line a deep dish with rich thick crust; pare and cut into halves
or quarters some juicy, rather tart peaches; put in sugar, spices
and flavoring to taste; stew it slightly and put it in the lined
dish; cover with thick crust of rich puff paste and bake a rich
brown; when done, break up the top crust into small pieces and stir
it into the fruit; serve hot or cold; very palatable without sauce,
but more so with plain rich cream or cream sauce, or with a rich
brandy or wine. Other fruits can be used in place of peaches.
Currants are best made in this manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>Press the currants through a sieve to free it from pips; to each
pint of the pulp put two ounces of crumbed bread and four ounces of
sugar; bake with a rim of puff paste; serve with cream. White
currants may be used instead of red.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOMINY PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Two-thirds of a cupful of hominy, one and a half pints of milk,
two eggs, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of extract
of lemon or vanilla, one cupful of sugar. Boil hominy in milk one
hour; then pour it on the eggs, extract and sugar beaten together;
add butter, pour in buttered pudding-dish, bake in hot oven for
twenty minutes.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 414]</span><a name='Page_414' id=
"Page_414"></a>
<p><b>BAKED BERRY ROLLS.</b></p>
<p>Roll rich biscuit dough thin, cut it into little squares four
inches wide and seven inches long. Spread over with berries. Roll
up the crust, and put the rolls in a dripping-pan just a little
apart; put a piece of butter on each roll, spices if you like.
Strew over a large handful of sugar, a little hot water. Set in the
oven and bake like dumplings. Served with sweet sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN CORN PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Take two dozen full ears of sweet green corn, score the kernels
and cut them from the cob. Scrape off what remains on the cob with
a knife. Add a pint and a half or one quart of milk, according to
the youngness and juiciness of the corn. Add four eggs well beaten,
a half teacupful of flour, a half teacupful butter, a tablespoonful
of sugar, and salt to taste. Bake in a well-greased earthen dish,
in hot oven two hours. Place it on the table browned and smoking
hot, eat it with plenty of fresh butter. This can be used as a
dessert by serving a sweet sauce with it. If eaten plainly with
butter, it answers as a side vegetable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GENEVA WAFERS.</b></p>
<p>Two eggs, three ounces of butter, three ounces of flour, three
ounces of pounded sugar. Well whisk the eggs, put them into a basin
and stir to them the butter, which should be beaten to a cream; add
the flour and sifted sugar gradually, and then mix all well
together. Butter a baking sheet, and drop on it a teaspoonful of
the mixture at a time, leaving a space between each. Bake in a cool
oven; watch the pieces of paste, and, when half done, roll them up
like wafers and put in a small wedge of bread or piece of wood, to
keep them in shape. Return them to the oven until crisp. Before
serving, remove the bread, put a spoonful of preserve in the widest
end, and fill up with whipped cream. This is a very pretty and
ornamental dish for the supper-table, and is very nice and very
easily made.</p>

sifting it through <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 415]</span><a name=
'Page_415' id="Page_415"></a>your fingers, a handful at a time,
until it becomes smooth and quite thick. Turn it into a dish that
has been dipped in water. Make a sauce very sweet to serve with it.
Maple molasses is <i>fine</i> with it. This pudding is much
improved by adding canned berries or fresh ones just before taking
from the stove.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MINUTE PUDDING. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>One quart of milk, salt, two eggs, about a pint of flour. Beat
the eggs well; add the flour and enough milk to make it smooth.
Butter the saucepan and put in the remainder of the milk well
salted; when it boils, stir in the flour, eggs, etc., lightly; let
it cook well. It should be of the consistency of thick corn mush.
Serve immediately with the following simple sauce, <i>viz</i>: Rich
milk or cream sweetened to taste and flavored with grated
nutmeg.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUNDERLAND PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of sugar, half a cupful of cold butter, a pint of
milk, two cupfuls of sifted flour and five eggs. Make the milk hot;
stir in the butter and let it cool before the other ingredients are
added to it; then stir in the sugar, flour and eggs, which should
be well whisked and omit the whites of two; flavor with a little
grated lemon rind and beat the mixture well. Butter some small
cups, rather more than half fill them; bake from twenty minutes to
half an hour, according to the size of the puddings, and serve with
fruit, custard or wine sauce, a little of which may be poured over
them. They may be dropped by spoonfuls on buttered tins and baked,
if cups are not convenient.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JELLY PUDDINGS.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of <i>very</i> fine stale biscuit or bread crumbs,
one cupful of rich milk&mdash;half cream, if you can get it; five
eggs beaten very light, half a teaspoonful of soda stirred in
boiling water, one cupful of sweet jelly, jam or marmalade. Scald
the milk and pour over the crumbs. Beat until half cold and stir in
the beaten yolks, then whites, finally the soda. Fill large cups
half full with the batter, set in a quick oven and bake half an
hour. When done, turn out quickly and dexterously; with a sharp
knife make an incision in the side of each; pull partly open, and
put a liberal spoonful of the conserve within. <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 416]</span><a name='Page_416' id="Page_416"></a>Close
the slit by pinching the edges with your fingers. Eat warm with
sweetened cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>QUICK PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Soak and split some crackers; lay the surface over with raisins
and citron; put the halves together, tie them in a bag, and boil
fifteen minutes in milk and water; delicious with rich sauce.</p>
<br>
<p><b>READY PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Make a batter of one quart of milk and about one pound of flour;
add six eggs, the yolks and whites separately beaten, a teaspoonful
of salt and four tablespoonfuls of sugar. It should be as stiff as
can possibly be stirred with a spoon. Dip a spoonful at a time into
quick boiling water, boil from five to ten minutes, take out. Serve
hot with sauce or syrup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A ROYAL DESSERT.</b></p>
<p>Cut a stale cake into slices an inch and a half in thickness;
pour over them a little good sweet cream; then fry <i>lightly</i>
in fresh butter in a smooth frying pan; when done, place over each
slice of cake a layer of preserves or you may make a rich sauce to
be served with it.</p>
<p>Another dish equally as good, is to dip thin slices of bread
into fresh milk; have ready two eggs well beaten; dip the slices in
the egg and fry them in butter to a light brown; when fried, pour
over them a syrup, any kind that you choose, and serve hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HUCKLEBERRIES WITH CRACKERS AND CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Pick over carefully one quart of blueberries and keep them on
ice until wanted. Put into each bowl, for each guest, two soda
crackers, broken in not too small pieces; add a few tablespoonfuls
of berries, a teaspoonful of powdered sugar and fill the bowl with
the richest of cold sweet cream. This is an old-fashioned New
England breakfast dish. It also answers for a dessert.</p>

when light and creamy, add the well-beaten yolks of four eggs. Stir
into this one wine-glass of wine or one of brandy, a pinch of salt
and one large cupful of hot cream or rich milk. Beat this mixture
well; place it in a saucepan over the fire, stir it until it cooks
sufficiently to thicken like cream. Be sure and not let it boil.
Delicious.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LIQUID BRANDY SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Brown over the fire three tablespoonfuls of sugar; add a cupful
of water, six whole cloves and a piece of stick cinnamon, the
yellow rind of a lemon cut very thin; let the sauce boil, strain

<br>
<p><b>GRANDMOTHERS SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Cream together a cupful of sifted sugar and half a cupful of
butter, add a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon and an egg well
beaten. Boil a teacupful of milk and turn it, boiling hot, over the

smoothly. It may be served cold or hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUGAR SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>One coffeecupful of granulated sugar, half of a cupful of water,
a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Boil all together until it
becomes the consistency of syrup. Flavor with lemon or vanilla
extract. A tablespoonful of lemon juice is an improvement. Nice
with cottage pudding.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of sugar, half a cupful of butter, one egg beaten
light, one lemon, juice and grated rind, half a cupful of boiling

serve hot in a sauce tureen.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 419]</span><a name='Page_419' id=
"Page_419"></a>
<p><b>ORANGE CREAM SAUCE, HOT.</b></p>
<p>This is made as LEMON CREAM SAUCE, substituting orange for
lemon.</p>
<p>Creams for puddings, pies and fritters may be made in the same
manner with any other flavoring; if flour is used in making them,
it should boil in the milk three or four minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD LEMON SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Beat to a cream one teacupful of butter and two teacupfuls of
fine white sugar; then stir in the juice and grated rind of one
lemon; grate nutmeg upon the sauce and serve on a flat dish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLD ORANGE SAUCE.</b></p>

<p><b>COLD CREAM SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Stir to a cream one cupful of sugar, half a cupful of butter,
then add a cupful of sweet, thick cold cream, flavor to taste. Stir
well and set it in a cool place.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM SAUCE, WARM.</b></p>
<p>Heat a pint of cream slowly in a double boiler; when nearly
boiling, set it off from the fire, put into it half a cupful of
sugar, a little nutmeg or vanilla extract; stir it thoroughly and
add, when cool, the whites of two well-beaten eggs. Set it on the
fire in a dish containing hot water to keep it warm until needed,
stirring once or more.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CARAMEL SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Place over the fire a saucepan; when it begins to be hot, put
into it four tablespoonfuls of white sugar and one tablespoonful of
water. Stir it continually for three or four minutes, until all the
water evaporates; then watch it carefully until it becomes a
delicate brown color. Have ready a pint of cold water and cup of
sugar mixed with some flavoring; turn it into the saucepan with the
browned sugar and let it <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
420]</span><a name='Page_420' id="Page_420"></a>simmer for ten
minutes; then add half a glass of brandy or a glass of wine. The
wine or brandy may be omitted if preferred.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A GOOD PLAIN SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>A good sauce to go with plain fruit puddings is made by mixing
one cupful of brown sugar, one cupful of best molasses, half a
cupful of butter, one large teaspoonful of flour; add the juice and
grated rind of one lemon, half a nutmeg grated, half a teaspoonful
of cloves and cinnamon. When these are all stirred together, add a
teacupful of boiling water; stir it constantly, put into a saucepan
and let it boil until clear; then strain.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OLD STYLE SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>One pint of sour cream, the juice and finely grated rind of a
large lemon; sugar to taste. Beat hard and long until the sauce is
very light. This is delicious with cold "Brown Betty"&mdash;a form
of cold farina&mdash;cornstarch, blanc mange and the like.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN COLD, HARD SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Stir together one cupful of white sugar and half a cupful of
butter until it is creamy and light; add flavoring to taste. This
is very nice, flavored with the juice of raspberries or
strawberries, or beat into it a cupful of ripe strawberries or
raspberries and the white of an egg beaten stiff.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUSTARD SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of sugar, two beaten eggs, one pint of milk,
flavoring to taste, brandy or wine, if preferred.</p>
<p>Heat the milk to boiling; add by degrees the beaten eggs and
sugar, put in the flavoring and set within a pan of boiling water;
stir until it begins to thicken; then take it off and stir in the
brandy or wine gradually; set, until wanted, within a pan of
boiling water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MILK SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Dissolve a tablespoonful of flour in cold milk; see that it is
free from lumps. Whisk an ounce of butter and a cupful of sugar to
a cream and add to it a pinch of salt. Mix together half a pint of
milk, one egg and the flour; stir this into the butter and add a
dash of nutmeg, or any flavor; heat until near the boiling point
and serve. Very nice in place of cold cream.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 421]</span><a name='Page_421' id=
"Page_421"></a>
<p><b>MILK OR CREAM SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Cream or rich milk, simply sweetened with plenty of white sugar
and flavored, answers the purpose for some kinds of pudding, and
can be made very quickly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Two-thirds of a cupful of sugar, a pint of raspberries or
strawberries, a tablespoonful of melted butter and a cupful of hot
water. Boil all together slowly, removing the scum as fast as it
rises; then strain through a sieve. This is very good served with
dumplings or apple puddings.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JELLY SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Melt two tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a cupful of jelly over
the fire in a cupful of boiling water, adding also two
tablespoonfuls of butter; then stir into it a teaspoonful of
cornstarch, dissolved in half a cupful of water or wine; add it to
the jelly and let it come to a boil. Set it in a dish of hot water
to keep it warm until time to serve; stir occasionally. Any fruit
jelly can be used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COMMON SWEET SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>Into a pint of water stir a paste made of a tablespoonful of
cornstarch or flour (rubbed smooth with a little cold water); add a
cupful of sugar and a tablespoonful of vinegar. Cook well for three
minutes. Take from the fire and add a piece of butter as large as a
small egg; when cool, flavor with a tablespoonful of vanilla or
lemon extract.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SYRUP FOR FRUIT SAUCE.</b></p>
<p>An excellent syrup for fruit sauce is made of Morello cherries
(red, sour cherries). For each pound of cherry juice, allow half a
pound of sugar and six cherry kernels; seed the cherries and let
them stand in a bowl over night; in the morning, press them through
a fine cloth, which has been dipped in boiling water, weigh the
juice, add the sugar, boil fifteen minutes, removing all the scum.
Fill small bottles that are perfectly dry with the syrup; when it
is cold, cork the bottles tightly, seal them and keep them in a
cool place, standing upright.</p>

<p><b>ROSE BRANDY. (For Cakes and Puddings.)</b></p>
<p>Gather the leaves of roses while the dew is on them, and as soon
as they open put them into a wide-mouthed bottle, and when the
bottle is full pour in the best of fourth proof French brandy.</p>
<p>It will be fit for use in three or four weeks and may be
frequently replenished. It is sometimes considered preferable to
wine as a flavoring to pastries and pudding sauces.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON BRANDY. (For Cakes and Puddings.)</b></p>
<p>When you use lemons for punch or lemonade, do not throw away the
peels but cut them in small pieces&mdash;the thin yellow outside
(the thick part is not good)&mdash;and put them in a glass jar or
bottle of brandy. You will find this brandy useful for many
purposes.</p>
<p>In the same way keep for use the kernels of peach and plum
stones, pounding them slightly before you put them into the
brandy.</p>

<h2><b>PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Fruit for preserving should be sound and free from all defects,
using white sugar, and also that which is dry, which produces the
nicest syrup; dark sugar can be used by being clarified, which is
done by dissolving two pounds of sugar in a pint of water; add to
it the white of an egg and beat it well, put it into a preserving
kettle on the fire and stir with a wooden spoon. As soon as it
begins to swell and boil up, throw in a little cold water; let it
boil up again, take it off and remove the scum; boil it again,
throw in more cold water and remove the scum; repeat until it is
clear and pours like oil from the spoon.</p>
<p>In the old way of preserving, we used pound for pound, when they
were kept in stone jars or crocks; now, as most preserves are put
up in sealed jars or cans, less sugar seems sufficient;
three-quarters of a pound of sugar is generally all that is
required for a pound of fruit.</p>
<p>Fruit should be boiled in a porcelain-lined or granite-ware
dish, if possible; but other utensils, copper or metal, if made
bright and clean, answer as well.</p>
<p>Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be
converted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the
syrup, and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven,
adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will
gradually penetrate the fruit, while the fluid parts of the syrup
gently evaporate. They should be dried in the stove or oven on a
sieve, and turned every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar
being sifted over them every time they are turned. Afterwards they
are to be kept in a dry situation, in drawers or boxes. Currants
and cherries preserved whole in this manner, in bunches, are
extremely elegant and have a fine flavor. In this way it is, also,
that orange and lemon chips are preserved.</p>
<p>Mold can be prevented from forming on fruit jellies by pouring a
little melted paraffine over the top. When cool, it will harden to
a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 424]</span><a name='Page_424' id=
"Page_424"></a>solid cake, winch can be easily removed when the
jelly is used, and saved to use over again another year. It is
perfectly harmless and tasteless.</p>
<p>Large glass tumblers are the best for keeping jellies, much
better than large vessels, for by being opened frequently they soon
spoil; a paper should be cut to fit and placed over the jelly; then
put on the lid or cover, with thick paper rubbed over on the inside
with the white of an egg.</p>
<p>There cannot be too much care taken in selecting fruit for
jellies, for if the fruit is over ripe, any amount of time in
boiling will never make it jelly&mdash;there is where so many fail
in making good jelly; and another important matter is
overlooked&mdash;that of carefully skimming off the juice after it
begins to boil and a scum rises from the bottom to the top; the
juice should not be stirred, but the scum carefully taken off; if
allowed to boil under, the jelly will not be clear.</p>
<p>When either preserves or canned fruits show any indications of
fermentation, they should be immediately re-boiled with more sugar,
to save them. It is much better to be generous with the sugar at
first than to have any losses afterwards. Keep all preserves in a
cool, dry closet.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED CHERRIES.</b></p>
<p>Take large, ripe Morello cherries; weigh them and to each pound
allow a pound of loaf sugar. Stone the cherries (opening them with
a sharp quill) and save the juice that comes from them in the
process. As you stone them, throw them into a large pan or tureen
and strew about half the sugar over them and let them lie in it an
hour or two after they are all stoned. Then put them into a
preserving kettle with the remainder of the sugar and boil and skim
them till the fruit is clear and the syrup thick.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED CRANBERRIES.</b></p>
<p>The cranberries must be large and ripe. Wash them and to six
quarts of cranberries allow nine pounds of the beat loaf sugar.
Take three quarts of the cranberries and put them into a stewpan
with a pint and a half of water. Cover the pan and boil or stew
them till they are all to pieces. Then squeeze the juice through a
jelly bag. Put the sugar into a preserving kettle, pour the
cranberry juice over it and let it stand until it is all melted,
stirring it up frequently. Then place the kettle over the fire and
put in the remaining three quarts of whole <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 425]</span><a name='Page_425' id=
"Page_425"></a>cranberries. Let them boil till they are tender,
clear and of a bright color, skimming them frequently. When done,
put them warm into jars with the syrup, which should be like a
thick jelly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES.</b></p>
<p>For every pound of fruit weigh a pound of refined sugar; put
them with the sugar over the fire in a porcelain kettle, bring to a
boil slowly about twenty minutes. Take them out carefully with a
perforated skimmer and fill your <i>hot</i> jars nearly full; boil
the juice a few minutes longer and fill up the jars; seal them
<i>hot</i>. Keep in a cool, dry place.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO PRESERVE BERRIES WHOLE. (Excellent.)</b></p>
<p>Buy the fruit when not <i>too ripe</i>, pick over immediately,
wash if absolutely necessary and put in glass jars, filling each
one about two-thirds full.</p>
<p>Put in the preserving kettle a pound of sugar and one cupful of
water for every two pounds of fruit, and let it come slowly to a
boil. Pour this syrup into the jars over the berries, filling them
up to the brim; then set the jars in a pot of <i>cold</i> water on
the stove, and let the water boil and the fruit become scalding
hot. Now take them out and seal perfectly tight. If this process is
followed thoroughly, the fruit will keep for several years.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED EGG PLUMS.</b></p>
<p>Use a pound of sugar for a pound of plums; wash the plums and
wipe dry; put the sugar on a slow fire in the preserving kettle,
with as much water as will melt the sugar and let it simmer slowly;
then prick each plum thoroughly with a needle, or a fork with fine
prongs, and place a layer of them in the syrup; let them cook until
they lose their color a little and the skins begin to break; then
lift them out with a perforated skimmer and place them singly in a
large dish to cool; then put another layer of plums in the syrup
and let them cook and cool in the same manner, until the whole are
done; as they cool, carefully replace the broken skins so as not to
spoil the appearance of the plums; when the last layer is finished,
return the first to the kettle, and boil until transparent; do the
same with each layer; while the latest cooked are cooling, place
the first in glass jars; when all are done, pour the hot syrup over
them; when they are cold, close as usual; the jelly should be of
the color and consistency of rich wine jelly.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 426]</span><a name='Page_426' id=
"Page_426"></a>
<p><b>PRESERVED PEACHES.</b></p>
<p>Peaches for preserving may be ripe but not soft; cut them in
halves, take out the stones and pare them neatly; take as many
pounds of white sugar as of fruit, put to each pound of sugar a
teacupful of water; stir it until it is dissolved; set it over a
moderate fire; when it is boiling hot, put in the peaches; let them
boil gently until a pure, clear, uniform color; turn those at the
bottom to the top carefully with a skimmer several times; do not
hurry them. When they are clear, take each half up with a spoon and
spread them on flat dishes to become cold. When all are done, let
the syrup boil until it is quite thick; pour it into a large
pitcher and let it set to cool and settle. When the peaches are
cold put them carefully into jars and pour the syrup over them,
leaving any sediment which has settled at the bottom, or strain the
syrup. Some of the kernels from the peach-stones may be put in with
the peaches while boiling. Let them remain open one night, then
cover.</p>
<p>In like manner quince, plum, apricot, apple, cherry, greengage
and other fruit preserves are made; in every case fine large fruit
should be taken, free from imperfections, and the slightest bruises
or other fault should be removed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED GREEN TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Take one peck of green tomatoes. Slice six fresh lemons without
removing the skins, but taking out the seeds; put to this quantity
six pounds of sugar, common white, and boil until transparent and
the syrup thick. Ginger root may be added, if liked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED APPLES. (Whole.)</b></p>
<p>Peel and core large firm apples (pippins are best). Throw them
into water as you pare them. Boil the parings in water for fifteen
minutes, allowing a pint to one pound of fruit. Then strain and,
adding three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pint of water, as
measured at first, with enough lemon peel, orange peel or mace, to
impart a pleasant flavor, return to the kettle. When the syrup has
been well skimmed and is clear, pour it boiling hot over the
apples, which must be drained from the water in which they have
hitherto stood. Let them remain in the syrup until both are
perfectly cold. Then, covering closely, let them simmer over a slow
fire until transparent. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
427]</span><a name='Page_427' id="Page_427"></a>When all the
minuti&aelig; of these directions are attended to, the fruit will
remain unbroken and present a beautiful and inviting
appearance.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED QUINCES.</b></p>
<p>Pare, core and quarter your fruit, then weigh it and allow an
equal quantity of white sugar. Take the parings and cores and put
in a preserving kettle; cover them with water and boil for half an
hour; then strain through a hair-sieve, and put the juice back into
the kettle and boil the quinces in it a little at a time until they
are tender; lift out as they are done with a drainer and lay on a
dish; if the liquid seems scarce add more water. When all are
cooked, throw into this liquor the sugar, and allow it to boil ten
minutes before putting in the quinces; let them boil until they
change color, say one hour and a quarter, on a slow fire; while
they are boiling occasionally slip a silver spoon under them to see
that they do not burn, but on no account stir them. Have two fresh
lemons cut in thin slices, and when the fruit is being put in jars
lay a slice or two in each. Quinces may be steamed until
tender.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED PEARS.</b></p>
<p>One pound of fruit, one pound of sugar; pare off the peeling
thin. Make a nice syrup of nearly one cupful of water and one pound
of sugar, and when clarified by boiling and skimming put in the
pears and stew gently until clear. Choose rather pears like the
Seckle for preserving, both on account of the flavor and size. A
nice way is to stick a clove in the blossom end of each pear, for
this fruit seems to require some extraneous flavor to bring out its
own piquancy. Another acceptable addition to pear preserves may be
found instead, by adding the juice and thinly pared rind of one
lemon to each five pounds of fruit. If the pears are hard and
tough, parboil them until tender before beginning to preserve, and
from the same water take what you need for making their syrup.</p>
<p>If you can procure only large pears to preserve, cut them into
halves, or even slices, so that they can get done more quickly, and
lose nothing in appearance, either.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PINEAPPLE PRESERVES.</b></p>
<p>Twist off the top and bottom and pare off the rough outside of
pineapples; then weigh them and cut them in slices, chips or
quarters, or <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 428]</span><a name=
'Page_428' id="Page_428"></a>cut them in four or six and shape each
piece like a whole pineapple; to each pound of fruit, put a
teacupful of water; put it in a preserving kettle, cover it and set
it over the fire and let them boil gently until they are tender and
clear; then take them from the water, by sticking a fork in the
centre of each slice, or with a skimmer, into a dish.</p>
<p>Put to the water white sugar, a pound for each pound of fruit;
stir it until it is all dissolved; then put in the pineapple, cover
the kettle and boil them gently until transparent throughout; when
it is so, take it out, let it cool and put it in glass jars; let
the syrup boil or simmer gently until it is thick and rich and when
nearly cool, pour it over the fruit. The next day secure the jars,
as before directed.</p>
<p>Pineapple done in this way is a beautiful and delicious
preserve. The usual manner of preserving it by putting it into the
syrup without first boiling it, makes it little better than
sweetened leather.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO PRESERVE WATERMELON RIND AND CITRON.</b></p>
<p>Pare off the green skin, cut the watermelon rind into pieces.
Weigh the pieces and allow to each pound a pound and a half of loaf
sugar. Line your kettle with green vine-leaves, and put in the
pieces <i>without</i> the sugar. A layer of vine-leaves must cover
each layer of melon rind. Pour in water to cover the whole and
place a thick cloth over the kettle. Simmer the fruit for two
hours, after scattering a few bits of alum amongst it. Spread the
melon rind on a dish to cool. Melt the sugar, using a pint of water
to a pound and a half of sugar, and mix with it some beaten white
of egg. Boil and skim the sugar. When quite clear, put in the rind
and let it boil two hours; take out the rind, boil the syrup again,
pour it over the rind, and let it remain all night. The next
morning, boil the syrup with lemon juice, allowing one lemon to a
quart of syrup. When it is thick enough to hang in a drop from the
point of a spoon, it is done. Put the rind in jars and pour over it
the syrup. It is not fit for use immediately.</p>
<p>Citrons may be preserved in the same manner, first paring off
the outer skin and cutting them into quarters. Also green
limes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO PRESERVE AND DRY GREENGAGES.</b></p>
<p>To every pound of sugar allow one pound of fruit, one quarter
pint of water.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 429]</span><a name='Page_429' id=
"Page_429"></a>
<p>For this purpose, the fruit must be used before it is quite ripe
and part of the stalk must be left on. Weigh the fruit, rejecting
all that is in the least degree blemished, and put it into a lined
saucepan with the sugar and water, which should have been
previously boiled together to a rich syrup. Boil the fruit in this
for ten minutes, remove it from the fire, and drain the greengages.
The next day boil up the syrup and put in the fruit again, let it
simmer for three minutes, and drain the syrup away. Continue this
process for five or six days, and the last time place the
greengages, when drained, on a hair-sieve, and put them in an oven
or warm spot to dry; keep them in a box, with paper between each
layer, in a place free from damp.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVED PUMPKINS.</b></p>
<p>To each pound of pumpkin allow one pound of roughly pounded loaf
sugar, one gill of lemon juice.</p>
<p>Obtain a good, sweet pumpkin; halve it, take out the seeds and
pare off the rind; cut it into neat slices. Weigh the pumpkin, put
the slices in a pan or deep dish in layers, with the sugar
sprinkled between them; pour the lemon juice over the top, and let
the whole remain for two or three days. Boil all together, adding
half a pint of water to every three pounds of sugar used until the
pumpkin becomes tender; then turn the whole into a pan, where let
it remain for a week; then drain off the syrup, boil it until it is
quite thick, skim, and pour it boiling over the pumpkin. A little
bruised ginger and lemon rind, thinly pared, may be boiled in the
syrup to flavor the pumpkin.</p>

<br>
<p><b>PRESERVING FRUIT. (New Mode.)</b></p>
<p>Housekeepers who dislike the tedious, old-time fashion of
clarifying sugar and boiling the fruit, will appreciate, the
following two recipes, no fire being needed in their preparation.
The first is for "tutti frutti," and has been repeatedly tested
with unvarying success.</p>
<p>Put one quart of white, preserving, fine Batavia brandy into a
two-gallon stone jar that has a tightly fitting top. Then for every
pound of fruit, in prime condition and perfectly dry, which you put
in the brandy, use three-quarters of a pound of granulated sugar;
stir every day so that the sugar will be dissolved, using a clean,
wooden spoon kept for the purpose. Every sort of fruit may be used,
beginning with strawberries and ending with plums. Be sure and have
at least one <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 430]</span><a name=
'Page_430' id="Page_430"></a>pound of black cherries, as they make
the color of the preserve very rich. Strawberries, raspberries,
blackberries, apricots, cherries (sweet and sour), peaches, plums,
are all used, and, if you like, currants and grapes. Plums and
grapes should be peeled and seeded, apricots and peaches peeled and
cut in quarters or eighths or dice; cherries also must be seeded;
quinces may be steamed until tender. The jar must be kept in a
cool, dry place, and the daily stirring must never be forgotten,
for that is the secret of success. You may use as much of one sort
of fruit as you like, and it may be put in from day to day, just as
you happen to have it. Half the quantity of spirits may be used.
The preserve will be ready for use within a week after the last
fruit is put in, and will keep for a number of months. We have
found it good eight months after making.</p>
<p>The second is as follows: Take some pure white vinegar and mix
with it granulated sugar until a syrup is formed quite free from
acidity. Pour this syrup into earthen jars and put in it good,
perfectly ripe fruit, gathered in dry weather. Cover the jars tight
and put them in a dry place. The contents will keep for six or
eight months, and the flavor of the fruit will be excellent.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO PRESERVE FRUIT WITHOUT 'SUGAR.</b></p>
<p>Cherries, strawberries, sliced pineapple, plums, apricots,
gooseberries, etc., may be preserved in the following
manner&mdash;to be used the same as fresh fruit.</p>
<p>Gather the fruit before it is very ripe; put it in wide-mouthed
bottles made for the purpose; fill them as full as they will hold
and cork them tight; seal the corks; put some hay in a large
saucepan, set in the bottles, with hay between them to prevent
their touching; then fill the saucepan with water to the necks of
the bottles, and set it over the fire until the water is nearly
boiled, then take it off; let it stand until the bottles are cold.
Keep them in a cool place until wanted, when the fruit will be
found equal to fresh.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NEW METHOD OF PRESERVING FRUIT.</b></p>
<p>A new method of preserving fruit is practiced in England. Pears,
apples and other fruits are reduced to a paste by jamming, which is
then pressed into cakes and gently dried. When required for use it
is only necessary to pour four times their weight of boiling water
over <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 431]</span><a name='Page_431' id=
"Page_431"></a>them and allow them to soak for twenty minutes and
then add sugar to suit the taste. The fine flavor of the fruit is
said to be retained to perfection. The cost of the prepared product
is scarcely greater than that of the original fruit, differing with
the supply and price of the latter; the keeping qualities are
excellent, so that it may be had at any time of the year and bears
long sea-voyages with out detriment. No peeling or coring is
required, so there is no waste.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT JELLIES.</b></p>
<p>Take a stone jar and put in the fruit, place this in a kettle of
tepid water and set on the fire; let it boil, closely covered,
until the fruit is broken to pieces; strain, pressing the bag, a
stout, coarse one, hard, putting in a few handfuls each time, and
between each squeezing turning it inside out to scald off the pulp
and skins; to each pint of juice allow a pound of loaf sugar; set
the juice on alone to boil, and, while it is boiling, put the sugar
into shallow dishes or pans, and heat it in the oven, watching and
stirring it to prevent burning; boil the juice just twenty minutes
from the time it begins fairly to boil; by this time the sugar
should be <i>very</i> hot; throw it into the boiling juice,
stirring rapidly all the time; withdraw the spoon when all is
thoroughly dissolved; let the jelly come to a boil to make all
certain; withdraw the kettle instantly from the fire; roll your
glasses and cups in hot water, and fill with the scalding liquid;
the jelly will form within an hour; when cold, close and tie up as
you do preserves.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRANT JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Currants for jelly should be perfectly ripe and gathered the
<i>first</i> week of the season; they lose their jelly property if
they hang on the bushes too long, and become too juicy&mdash;the
juice will not be apt to congeal. Strip them from the stalks, put
them into a stone jar, and set in a vessel of hot water over the
fire; keep the water around it boiling until the currants are all
broken, stirring them up occasionally. Then squeeze them through a
coarse cloth or towel. To each pint of juice allow a pound and a
quarter of refined sugar. Put the sugar into a porcelain kettle,
pour the juice over it, stirring frequently. Skim it before it
boils; boil about twenty minutes, or until <span class=
'pagenum'>[Pg 432]</span><a name='Page_432' id="Page_432"></a>it
congeals in the spoon when held in the air. Pour it into hot jelly
glasses and seal when cool.</p>
<p>Wild frost grape jelly is nice made after this recipe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRANT JELLY. (New Method.)</b></p>
<p>This recipe for making superior jelly without heat is given in a
Parisian journal of chemistry, which may be worth trying by some of
our readers. The currants are to be washed and squeezed in the
usual way, and the juice placed in a stone or earthen vessel, and
set away in a cool place in the cellar. In about twenty-four hours
a considerable amount of froth will cover the surface, produced by
fermentation, and this must be removed and the whole strained again
through the jelly bag, then weighed, and an equal weight of
powdered white sugar is to be added. This is to be stirred
constantly until entirely dissolved, and then put into jars, tied
up tightly and set away. At the end of another twenty-four hours a
perfectly transparent jelly of the most satisfactory flavor will be
formed, which will keep as long as if it had been cooked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>QUINCE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Quinces for jelly should not be quite ripe, they should be a
fine yellow; rub off the down from them, core and cut them small;
put them in a preserving kettle with a teacupful of water for each
pound; let them stew gently until soft, without mashing; put them
in a thin muslin bag with the liquor; press them very lightly; to
each pint of the liquor put a pound of sugar; stir it until it is
all dissolved, then set it over the fire and let it boil gently,
until by cooling some on a plate you find it a good jelly; then
turn it into pots or tumblers and, when cold, secure as directed
for jellies.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RASPBERRY JELLY.</b></p>
<p>To each pint of juice allow one pound of sugar. Let the
raspberries be freshly gathered, quite ripe, pick from the stalks;
put them into a large jar after breaking the fruit a little with a
wooden spoon, and place this jar, covered, in a saucepan of boiling
water. When the juice is well drawn, which will be in from
three-quarters to one hour, strain the fruit through a fine
hair-sieve or cloth; measure the juice, and to every pint allow the
above proportion of white sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a
preserving pan, place it over the fire, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
433]</span><a name='Page_433' id="Page_433"></a>and boil gently
until the jelly thickens, when a little is poured on a plate;
carefully remove all the scum as it rises, pour the jelly into
small pots, cover down, and keep in a dry place. This jelly answers
for making raspberry cream and for flavoring various sweet dishes,
when, in winter, the fresh fruit is not obtainable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Select apples that are rather tart and highly flavored; slice
them without paring; place in a porcelain preserving kettle, cover
with water, and let them cook slowly until the apples look red.
Pour into a colander, drain off the juice, and let this run through
a jelly-bag; return to the kettle, which must be carefully washed,
and boil half an hour; measure it and allow to every pint of juice
a pound of sugar and half the juice of a lemon; boil quickly for
ten minutes.</p>
<p>The juice of apples boiled in shallow vessels, without a
particle of sugar, makes the most sparkling, delicious jelly
imaginable. Red apples will give jelly the color and clearness of
claret, while that from light fruit is like amber. Take the cider
just as it is made, not allowing it to ferment at all, and, if
possible, boil it in a pan, flat, very large and shallow.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRAPE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Mash well the berries so as to remove the skins; pour all into a
preserving kettle and cook slowly for a few minutes to extract the
juice; strain through a colander, and then through a flannel
jelly-bag, keeping as hot as possible, for if not allowed to cool
before putting again on the stove the jelly conies much stiffer; a
few quince seeds boiled with the berries the first time tend to
stiffen it; measure the juice, allowing a pound of sugar to every
pint of juice, and boil fast for at least half an hour. Try a
little, and if it seems done, remove and put into glasses.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLORIDA ORANGE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Grate the yellow rind of two Florida oranges and two lemons, and
squeeze the juice into a porcelain-lined preserving kettle, adding
the juice of two more oranges, and removing all the seeds; put in
the grated rind a quarter of a pound of sugar, or more if the fruit
is sour, and a gill of water, and boil these ingredients together
until a rich syrup is formed; meantime, dissolve two ounces of
gelatine in a quart of warm water, stirring it over the fire until
it is entirely dis<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 434]</span><a name=
'Page_434' id="Page_434"></a>solved, then add the syrup, strain the
jelly, and cool it in molds wet in cold water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRAB-APPLE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>The apples should be juicy and ripe. The fruit is then
quartered, the black spots in the cores removed, afterward put into
a preserving kettle over the fire, with a teacupful of water in the
bottom to prevent burning; more water is added as it evaporates
while cooking. When boiled to a pulp, strain the apples through a
coarse flannel, then proceed as for currant jelly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Pare the peaches, take out the stones, then slice them; add to
them about a quarter of the kernels. Place them in a kettle with
enough water to cover them. Stir them often until the fruit is well
cooked, then strain, and to every pint of the juice add the juice
of a lemon; measure again, allowing a pound of sugar to each pint
of juice; heat the sugar very hot, and add when the juice has
boiled twenty minutes; let it come to a boil and take instantly
from the fire.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE SYRUP.</b></p>
<p>Pare the oranges, squeeze and strain the juice from the pulp. To
one pint of juice allow one pound and three-quarters of loaf sugar.
Put the juice and sugar together, boil and skim it until it is
cream; then strain it through a flannel bag and let it stand until
it becomes cool, then put in bottles and cork tight.</p>
<p>Lemon syrup is made in the same way, except that you scald the
lemons and squeeze out the juice, allowing rather more sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE MARMALADE.</b></p>
<p>Allow pound for pound. Pare half the oranges and cut the rind
into shreds. Boil in three waters until tender and set aside. Grate
the rind of the remaining oranges; take off, and throw away every
bit of the thick white inner skin; quarter all the oranges and take
out the seeds. Chop or cut them into small pieces; drain all the
juice that will come away without pressing them over the sugar;
heat this, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, adding a
<i>very</i> little water, unless the oranges are very juicy. Boil
and skim five or six minutes; put in the boiled shreds and cook ten
minutes; then the chopped fruit and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
435]</span><a name='Page_435' id="Page_435"></a>grated peel, and
boil twenty minutes longer. When cold, put into small jars, tied up
with bladder or paper next the fruit, cloths dipped in wax over
all. A nicer way still is to put away in tumblers with
self-adjusting metal tops. Press brandied tissue paper down closely
to the fruit.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON MARMALADE</b></p>
<p>Is made as you would prepare orange&mdash;allowing a pound and a
quarter of sugar to a pound of the fruit, and using but half the
grated peel.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RAISINS. (A French Marmalade.)</b></p>
<p>This recipe is particularly valuable at seasons when fruit is
scarce. Take six fine large cooking apples, peel them, put them
over a slow fire, together with a wine-glass of Medeira wine and
half a pound of sugar. When well stewed, split and stone two and a
half pounds of raisins, and put them to stew with the apples and
enough water to prevent their burning. When all appears well
dissolved, beat it through a strainer bowl, and lastly through a
sieve. Mold, if you like, or put away in small preserve jars, to
cut in thin slices for the ornamentation of pastry, or to dish up
for eating with cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY JAM.</b></p>
<p>To each pound of fine and not too ripe berries, allow
three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Put them into a preserving pan
and stir gently, not to break up the fruit; simmer for one-half
hour and put into pots air-tight. An excellent way to seal jellies
and jams is as the German women do: cut round covers from writing
paper a half-inch too large for the tops, smear the inside with the
unbeaten white of an egg, tie over with a cord, and it will dry
quickly and be absolutely preservative. A circular paper dipped in
brandy and laid over the toothsome contents before covering, will
prevent any dampness from affecting the flavor. I have removed
covers heavy with mold to find the preserve intact.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOOSEBERRY JAM.</b></p>
<p>Pick the gooseberries just as they begin to turn. Stem, wash and
weigh. To four pounds of fruit add half a teacupful of water; boil
until soft and add four pounds of sugar and boil until clear. If
picked at the right stage the jam will be amber colored and firm,
and very much nicer than if the fruit is preserved when ripe.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 436]</span><a name='Page_436' id=
"Page_436"></a>
<p><b>BRANDIED PEACHES OR PEARS.</b></p>
<p>Four pounds of fruit, four pounds of sugar, one pint of best
white brandy. Make a syrup of the sugar and enough water to
dissolve it. Let this come to a boil; put the fruit in and boil
five minutes. Having removed the fruit carefully, let the syrup
boil fifteen minutes longer, or until it thickens well; add the
brandy and take the kettle at once from the fire; pour the hot
syrup over the fruit and seal. If, after the fruit is taken from
the fire, a reddish liquor oozes from it, drain this off before
adding the clear syrup. Put up in glass jars. Peaches and pears
should be peeled for brandying. Plums should be pricked and watched
carefully for fear of bursting.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RASPBERRY JAM.</b></p>
<p>To five or six pounds of fine red raspberries (not too ripe) add
an equal quantity of the finest quality of white sugar. Mash the
whole well in a preserving kettle; add about one quart of currant
juice (a little less will do) and boil gently till it jellies upon
a cold plate; then put into small jars; cover with brandied paper
and tie a thick white paper over them. Keep in a dark, dry and cool
place.</p>
<p>Blackberry or strawberry jam is made the same way, leaving out
the currant juice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A NEW WAY OF KEEPING FRUIT.</b></p>
<p>It is stated that experiments have been made in keeping fruit in
jars covered only with cotton batting, and at the end of two years
the fruit was sound. The following directions are given for the
process: Use crocks, stone butter-jars or any other convenient
dishes. Prepare and cook the fruit precisely as for canning in
glass jars; fill your dishes with fruit while hot and immediately
cover with cotton batting, securely tied on. Remember that all
putrefaction is caused by the invisible creatures in the air.
Cooking the fruit expels all these, and they cannot pass through
the cotton batting. The fruit thus protected will keep an
indefinite period. It will be remembered that Tyndall has proved
that the atmospheric germs cannot pass through a layer of
cotton.</p>

<p><b>MACEDOINES.</b></p>

grapes, cherries, berries, or currants on their stems, sections of
oranges, pineapples, or</a> brandied fruits, and pour in a little
jelly when quite cold, but not set. It makes a very agreeable
effect. By a little ingenuity you can imbed first one fruit and
then another, arranging in circles, and pour a little jelly
successively over each. Do not re-heat the jelly, but keep it in a
warm place, while the mold is on ice and the first layers are
hardening.</p>

<a name='CANNED_FRUITS' id="CANNED_FRUITS"></a>
<h2><b>CANNED FRUITS</b></h2>
<p>Berries and all ripe, mellow fruit require but little cooking,
only long enough for the sugar to penetrate. Strew sugar over them,
allow them to stand a few hours, then merely scald with the sugar;
half to three-quarters of a pound is considered sufficient. Harder
fruits like pears, quinces, etc., require longer boiling. The great
secret of canning is to make the fruit or vegetable perfectly
air-tight. It must be put up boiling hot and the vessel filled to
the brim.</p>
<p>Have your jars conveniently placed near your boiling fruit, in a
tin pan of hot water on the stove, roll them in the hot water, then
fill immediately with the hot, scalding fruit, fill to the top, and
seal quickly with the tops, which should also be heated;
occasionally screw down the tops tighter, as the fruit shrinks as
it cools, and the glass contracts and allows the air to enter the
cans. They must be perfectly air-tight. The jars to be kept in a
dark, cool, dry place.</p>
<p>Use glass jars for fruit always, and the fruit should be cooked
in a porcelain or granite-iron kettle. If you are obliged to use
common large-mouthed bottles with corks, steam the corks and pare
them to a close fit, driving them in with a mallet. Use the
following wax for sealing: One pound of resin, three ounces of
beeswax, one and one-half ounces of tallow. Use a brush in covering
the corks and as they cool, dip the mouth into the melted wax.
Place in a basin of cold water. Pack in a cool, dark and dry
cellar. After one week, examine for flaws, cracks or signs of
ferment.</p>
<p>The rubber rings used to assist in keeping the air from the
fruit cans sometimes become so dry and brittle as to be almost
useless. They can be restored to normal condition usually by
letting them lie in water in which you have put a little ammonia.
Mix in this proportion: One part of ammonia and two parts water.
Sometimes they do not need to lie in this more than five minutes,
but frequently a half hour is needed to restore their
elasticity.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 439]</span><a name='Page_439' id=
"Page_439"></a>
<p><b>CANNED PEACHES.</b></p>
<p>To one pound of peaches allow half a pound of sugar; to six
pounds of sugar add half a tumbler of water; put in the kettle a
layer of sugar and one of peaches until the whole of both are in.
Wash about eight peach leaves, tie them up and put into the kettle,
remembering to take them out when you begin to fill up the jars.
Let the sugared fruit remain on the range, but away from the fire,
until upon tipping the vessel to one side you can see some liquid;
then fill the jars, taking them out of hot water into which they
were put when cold, remaining until it was made to boil around
them. In this way you will find out if the glass has been properly
annealed; for we consider glass jars with stoppers screwing down
upon India-rubber rings as the best for canning fruit in families.
They should be kept in a dark closet; and although somewhat more
expensive than tin in the first instance, are much nicer and keep
for years with careful usage.</p>
<p>Fruit must be of fine flavor and <i>ripe</i>, though not
<i>soft</i>, to make nice canned fruit.</p>
<p>Peaches should be thrown into cold water as they are peeled, to
prevent a yellowish crust.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED GRAPES.</b></p>
<p>There is no fruit so difficult to can nicely as the grape; by
observing the following instructions you will find the grapes rich
and tender a year from putting up. Squeeze the pulp from the skin,
as the seeds are objectionable; boil the pulp, until the seeds
begin to loosen, in one kettle, having the skins boiling, in a
little water, hard in another kettle, as they are tough. When the
pulp seems tender, put it through the sieve; then add the skins, if
tender, with the water they boil in, if not too much. We use a
large coffeecupful of sugar for a quart can; boil until thick and
can in the usual way.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED STRAWBERRIES.</b></p>
<p>After the berries are picked over, let as many as can be put
carefully in the preserve kettle at once be placed on a platter. To
each pound of fruit add three-fourths of a pound of sugar; let them
stand two or three hours, till the juice is drawn from them; pour
it into the kettle and let it come to a boil and remove the scum
which rises; then put in the berries very carefully. As soon as
they come thoroughly to a boil put them in warm jars and seal while
boiling hot.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 440]</span><a name='Page_440' id=
"Page_440"></a>
<p><b>TO CAN QUINCES.</b></p>
<p>Cut the quinces into thin slices like apples for pies. To one
quart jarful of quince, take a coffeesaucer and a half of sugar and
a coffeecupful of water; put the sugar and water on the fire, and
when boiling put in the quinces; have ready the jars with their
fastenings, stand the jars in a pan of boiling water on the stove,
and when the quince is clear and tender put rapidly into the jars,
fruit and syrup together. The jars must be filled so that the syrup
overflows, and fastened up tight as quickly as possible.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED PINEAPPLE.</b></p>
<p>For six pounds of fruit, when cut and ready to can, make syrup
with two and a half pounds of sugar and nearly three pints of
water; boil syrup five minutes and skim or strain if necessary;
then add the fruit and let it boil up; have cans hot, fill and shut
up as soon as possible. Use the best white sugar. As the cans cool,
keep tightening them up. Cut the fruit half an inch thick.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED FRUIT JUICES.</b></p>
<p>Canned fruit juices are an excellent substitute for brandy or
wine in all puddings and sauces, etc.</p>
<p>It is a good plan to can the pure juices of fruit in the summer
time, putting it by for this purpose.</p>
<p>Select clean ripe fruit, press out the juice and strain it
through a flannel cloth. To each pint of juice add one cupful of
white granulated sugar. Put it in a porcelain kettle, bring it to
the boiling point, and bottle while hot in small bottles. It must
be sealed very tight while it is <i>hot</i>. Will keep a long time,
the same as canned fruit.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED TOMATOES.</b></p>
<p>Canning tomatoes is quite a simple process. A large or small
quantity may be done at a time, and they should be put in glass
jars in preference to those of tin, which are apt to injure the
flavor. Very ripe tomatoes are the best for the purpose. They are
first put into a large pan and covered with boiling water. This
loosens the skin, which is easily removed, and the tomatoes are
then put into the preserving kettle, set over a moderate fire
without the addition of water <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
441]</span><a name='Page_441' id="Page_441"></a>or any seasoning,
and brought to a boil. After boiling slowly one-half hour, they are
put into the jars while boiling hot and sealed tightly. They will
keep two or three years in this way. The jars should be filled to
the brim to prevent air from getting in, and set in a cool, dark
closet.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CAN CORN.</b></p>
<p>Split the kernels lengthwise with a knife, then scrape with the
back of the knife, thus leaving the hulls upon the cob. Fill cans
full of cut corn, pressing it in very hard. To press the corn in
the can, use the small end of a potato masher, as this will enter
the can easily. It will take from ten to a dozen large ears of corn
to fill a one-quart can. When the cans are full, screw cover on
with thumb and first finger; this will be tight enough, then place
a cloth in the bottom of a wash boiler to prevent breakage. On this
put a layer of cans in any position you prefer, over the cans put a
layer of cloth, then a layer of cans. Fill the boiler in this
manner, then cover the cans well with cold water, place the boiler
on the fire and <i>boil</i> three hours without ceasing. On steady
boiling depends much of your success. After boiling three hours,
lift the boiler from the fire, let the water cool, then take the
cans from the boiler and tighten, let them remain until cold, then
tighten again. Wrap each can in brown paper to exclude the light
and keep in a cool, dry cellar and be very sure the rubber rings
are not hardened by use. The rings should be renewed every two
years. I would advise the beginner to use new rings entirely, for
poor rings cause the loss of canned fruit and vegetables in many
cases. You will observe that in canning corn the cans are not
wrapped in a cloth nor heated; merely filled with the cut corn. The
corn in the can will shrink considerable in boiling, but on no
account open them after canning.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CAN PEAS.</b></p>
<p>Fill the can full of peas, shake the can so they can be filled
well. You cannot press the peas in the can as you did the corn, but
by shaking the cans they may be filled quite full. Pour into the
cans enough cold water to fill to overflowing, then screw the cover
tight as you can with your thumb and first finger and proceed
exactly as in canning corn.</p>
<p>String beans are cut as for cooking and canned in the same
manner. No seasoning of salt, pepper or sugar should be added.</p>

<p><b>CANNED PLUMS.</b></p>
<p>To every pound of plums allow a quarter of a pound of sugar. Put
the sugar and plums alternately into the preserving kettle, first
pricking the plums to prevent their breaking. Let them stand on the
back of the stove for an hour or two, then put them over a moderate
fire and allow to come to a boil; skim and pour at once into jars,
running a silver spoon handle around the inside of the jar to break
the air-bubbles; cover and screw down the tops.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED MINCE MEAT.</b></p>
<p>Mince meat for pies can be preserved for years if canned the
same as fruit while <i>hot</i>, and put into glass jars and sealed
perfectly tight, and set in a cool, dark place. One glass quart jar
will hold enough to make two ordinary-sized pies, and in this way
"mince pies" can be had in the middle of summer as well as in
winter, and if the cans are sealed properly, the meat will be just
as fine when opened as when first canned.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED BOILED CIDER.</b></p>
<p>Boiled cider, in our grandmothers' time, was indispensable to
the making of a good "mince pie," adding the proper flavor and
richness, which cannot be substituted by any other ingredient, and
a gill of which being added to a rule of "fruit cake" makes it more
moist, keeps longer, and is far superior to fruit cake made without
it. Boiled cider is an article rarely found in the market,
nowadays, but can be made by any one, with but little trouble and
expense, using <i>sweet</i> cider, shortly after it is made, and
before fermentation takes place. Place five quarts of <i>sweet</i>
cider in a porcelain-lined kettle over the fire, boil it slowly
until reduced to one quart, carefully watching it that it does not
burn; turn into glass jars while hot and seal tightly, the same as
canned fruit. It is then ready to use any time of the year.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED PUMPKIN.</b></p>
<p>Pumpkins or squash canned are far more convenient for ready use
than those dried in the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Cut up pumpkin or squash into small pieces, first cutting off
the peel; stew them until tender, add no seasoning; then mash them
very fine with a potato masher. Have ready your cans, made hot, and
then <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 443]</span><a name='Page_443' id=
"Page_443"></a>fill them with the hot pumpkin or squash, seal
tight; place in a dark, cool closet.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH BUTTER.</b></p>
<p>Pare ripe peaches and put them in a preserving kettle, with
sufficient water to boil them soft; then sift through a colander,
removing the stones. To each quart of peaches put one and one-half
pounds of sugar, and boil very slowly one hour. Stir often and do
not let them burn. Put in stone or glass jars, and keep in a cool
place.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACHES DRIED WITH SUGAR.</b></p>
<p>Peel yellow peaches, cut them from the stone in one piece; allow
two pounds of sugar to six pounds of fruit; make a syrup of
three-quarters of a pound of sugar and a little water; put in the
peaches, a few at a time, and let them cook gently until quite
clear. Take them up carefully on a dish and set them in the sun to
dry. Strew powdered sugar over them on all sides, a little at a
time; if any syrup is left, remove to fresh dishes. When they are
quite dry, lay them lightly in a jar with a little sugar sifted
between the layers.</p>

<h2><b>COLORING FOR FRUIT, ETC.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>RED OR PINK COLORING.</b></p>
<p>Take two cents' worth of cochineal. Lay it on a flat plate and
bruise it with the blade of a knife. Put it into half a teacupful
of alcohol. Let it stand a quarter of an hour, and then filter it
through fine muslin. Always ready for immediate use. Cork the
bottle tight.</p>
<p>Strawberry or cranberry juice makes a fine coloring for
frosting, sweet puddings and confectionery.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DEEP RED COLORING.</b></p>
<p>Take twenty grains of cochineal and fifteen grains of cream of
tartar finely powdered; add to them a piece of alum the size of a
cherry stone and boil them with a gill of soft water in an earthen
vessel, slowly, for half an hour. Then strain it through muslin,
and keep it tightly corked in a phial. If a little alcohol is added
it will keep any length of time.</p>
<br>
<p><b>YELLOW COLORING.</b></p>
<p>Take a little saffron, put it into an earthen vessel with a very
small quantity of cold, soft water, and let it steep till the color
of the infusion is a bright yellow. Then strain it, add half
alcohol to it. To color fruit yellow, boil the fruit with fresh
lemon skins in water to cover them until it is tender; then take it
up, spread it on dishes to cool and finish as may be directed.</p>
<p>To color icing, put the grated peel of a lemon or orange in a
thin muslin bag, squeezing a little juice through it, then mixing
with the sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GREEN COLORING.</b></p>
<p>Take fresh spinach or beet leaves and pound them in a marble
mortar. If you want it for immediate use, take off the green froth
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 445]</span><a name='Page_445' id=
"Page_445"></a>as it rises, and mix it with the article you intend
to color. If you wish to keep it a few days, take the juice when
you have pressed out a teacupful, and adding to it a piece of alum
the size of a pea, give it a boil in a saucepan. Or make the juice
very strong and add a quart of alcohol. Bottle it air-tight.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUGAR GRAINS.</b></p>
<p>These are made by pounding white lump sugar in a mortar and
shaking it through sieves of different degrees of coarseness, thus
accumulating grains of different sizes. They are used in
ornamenting cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUGAR GRAINS, COLORED.</b></p>
<p>Stir a little coloring&mdash;as the essence of spinach, or
prepared cochineal, or liquid carmine, or indigo, rouge, saffron,
etc.,&mdash;into the sugar grains made as above, until each grain
is stained, then spread them on a baking-sheet and dry them in a
warm place. They are used in ornamenting cake.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CARAMEL OR BURNT SUGAR.</b></p>
<p>Put one cupful of sugar and two teaspoonfuls of water in a
saucepan on the fire; stir constantly until it is quite a dark
color, then add a half cupful of water and a pinch of salt; let it
boil a few minutes and when cold, bottle.</p>
<p>For coloring soups, sauces or gravies.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLARIFY JELLY.</b></p>
<p>The white of egg is, perhaps, the best substance that can be
employed in clarifying jelly, as well as some other fluids, for the
reason that when albumen (and the white of egg is nearly pure
albumen) is put into a liquid that is muddy, from substances
suspended in it, on boiling coagulates in a flocculent manner, and,
entangling with the impurities, rises with them to the surface as a
scum, or sinks to the bottom, according to their weight.</p>

<a name='CONFECTIONERY' id="CONFECTIONERY"></a>
<h2><b>CONFECTIONERY</b></h2>
<br>
<p>In the making of confections the best <i>granulated</i> or
<i>loaf</i> sugar should be used. (Beware of glucose mixed with
sugar.) Sugar is boiled more or less, according to the kind of
candy to be made, and it is necessary to understand the proper
degree of sugar boiling to operate it successfully.</p>
<p>Occasionally sugar made into candies, "creams" or syrups, will
need clarifying. The process is as follows: Beat up well the white
of an egg with a cupful of cold water and pour it into a very clean
iron or thick new tin saucepan, and put into the pan four cupfuls
of sugar, mixed with a cupful of warm water. Put on the stove and
heat <i>moderately</i> until the scum rises. Remove the pan, and
skim off the top, then place on the fire again until the scum rises
again. Then remove as before, and so continue until no scum
rises.</p>
<p>This recipe is good for brown or yellowish sugar; for soft,
white sugars, half the white of an egg will do, and for refined or
loaf sugar a quarter will do.</p>
<p>The quantities of sugar and water are the same in all cases.
Loaf sugar will generally do for all candy-making without further
clarification. Brown or yellow sugars are used for caramels,
dark-colored cocoanut, taffy, and pulled molasses candies
generally.</p>
<p>Havana is the cheapest grade of white sugar and a shade or two
lighter than the brown.</p>
<p>Confectioners' A is superior in color and grain to the Havana.
It is a centrifugal sugar&mdash;that is, it is not re-boiled to
procure its white color, but is moistened with water and then put
into rapidly-revolving cylinders. The uncrystalized syrup or
molasses is whirled out of it, and the sugar comes out with a dry,
white grain.</p>
<p>ICING OR POWDERED SUGARS.&mdash;This is powdered loaf sugar.
Icing can only be made with powdered sugar which is produced by
grinding or crushing loaf sugar nearly as fine as flour.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 447]</span><a name='Page_447' id=
"Page_447"></a>
<p>GRANULATED SUGAR&mdash;This is a coarse-grained sugar, generally
very clean and sparkling, and fit for use as a colored sugar in
crystallized goods, and other superior uses.</p>
<p>This same syrup answers for most candies and should be boiled to
such a degree, that when a fork or splinter is dipped into it the
liquid will run off and form a thick drop on the end, and long
silk-like threads hang from it when exposed to the air. The syrup
never to be stirred while hot, or else it will grain, but if
intended for soft, French candies, should be removed, and, when
nearly cold, stirred to a cream. For hard, brittle candies, the
syrup should be boiled until, when a little is dropped in
<i>cold</i> water, it will crack and break when biting it.</p>
<p>The hands should be buttered when handling it, or it will stick
to them.</p>
<p>The top of the inside of the dish that the sugar or molasses is
to be cooked in should be buttered a few inches around the inside;
it prevents the syrup from rising and swelling any higher than
where it reaches the buttered edge.</p>
<p>For common crack candies, the sugar can be kept from graining by
adding a teaspoonful of vinegar or cream of tartar.</p>
<p>Colorings for candies should be harmless, and those used for
fruit and confectionery, on page 444, will be most suitable.</p>
<p>Essences and extracts should be bought at the druggist's, not
the poor kind usually sold at the grocer's.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH CREAM CANDY.</b></p>
<p>Put four cupfuls of white sugar and one cupful of water into a
bright tin pan on the range and let it boil without stirring for
ten minutes. If it looks somewhat thick, test it by letting some
drop from the spoon, and if it threads, remove the pan to the
table. Take out a small spoonful, and rub it against the side of a
cake bowl; if it becomes creamy, and will roll into a ball between
the fingers, pour the whole into the bowl. When cool enough to bear
your finger in it, take it in your lap, stir or beat it with a
large spoon, or pudding-stick. It will soon begin to look like
cream, and then grow stiffer until you find it necessary to take
your hands and work it like bread dough. If it is not boiled enough
to cream, set it back upon the range and let it remain one or two
minutes, or as long as is necessary, taking care not to cook it too
much. Add the flavoring as soon as it begins to cool. This is the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 448]</span><a name='Page_448' id=
"Page_448"></a>foundation of all French creams. It can be made into
rolls, and sliced off, or packed in plates and cut into small
cubes, or made into any shape imitating French candies. A pretty
form is made by coloring some of the cream pink, taking a piece
about as large as a hazel nut, and crowding an almond meat half way
into one side, till it looks like a bursting kernel. In working,
should the cream get too cold, warm it.</p>
<p>To be successful in making this cream, several points are to be
remembered; when the boiled sugar is cool enough to beat, if it
looks rough and has turned to sugar, it is because it has been
boiled <i>too much</i>, or has been <i>stirred</i>. If, after it is
beaten, it does not look like lard or thick cream, and is sandy or
sugary instead, it is because you did not let it get cool enough
before beating.</p>
<p>It is not boiled enough if it does not harden so as to work like
dough, and should not stick to the hands; in this case put it back
into the pan with an ounce of hot water, and cook over just enough,
by testing in water as above. After it is turned into the bowl to
cool, it should look clear as jelly. Practice and patience will
make perfect.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Add to "French Cream" raisins, currants, figs, a little citron,
chopped and mixed thoroughly through the cream while quite warm.
Make into bars or flat cakes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WALNUT CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Take a piece of "French Cream" the size of a walnut. Having
cracked some English walnuts, using care not to break the meats,
place one-half of each nut upon each side of the ball, pressing
them into the ball.</p>
<p>Walnut creams can be made by another method: First take a piece
of "French Cream," put it into a cup and setting the cup into a
vessel of boiling water, heating it until it turns like thick
cream; drop the walnut meats into it, one at a time, taking them
out on the end of a fork and placing on buttered paper; continue to
dip them until all are used, then go over again, giving them a
second coat of candy. They look nice colored pink and flavored with
vanilla.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Use "French Cream," and form it into small cone-shaped balls
with the fingers. Lay them upon paper to harden until all are
formed. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 449]</span><a name='Page_449' id=
"Page_449"></a>Melt one cake of Baker's chocolate in an earthen
dish or small basin; by setting it in the oven it will soon melt;
do not let it cook, but it <i>must</i> be kept <i>hot</i>.</p>
<p>Take the balls of cream, one at a time, on the tines of a fork,
pour the melted chocolate over them with a teaspoon and when well
covered, slip them from the fork upon oiled paper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Take two tablespoonfuls of grated cocoanut and half as much
"French candy;" work them both together with your hand till the
cocoanut is all well mixed in it. If you choose, you can add a drop
of vanilla. If too soft to work into balls, add confectioners'
sugar to stiffen; make into balls the size of hazelnuts and dip
twice, as in the foregoing recipes, flavoring the melted "French
Cream" with vanilla.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VARIEGATED CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Make the "French Cream" recipe, and divide into three parts,
leaving one part white, color one pink with cochineal syrup, and
the third part color brown with chocolate, which is done by just
letting the cream soften and stirring in a little finely grated
chocolate. The pink is colored by dropping on a few drops of
cochineal syrup while the cream is warm and beating it in. Take the
white cream, make a flat ball of it, and lay it upon a buttered
dish, and pat it out flat until about half an inch thick. If it
does not work easily, dip the hand in alcohol. Take the pink cream,
work in the same way as the white and lay it upon the white; then
the chocolate in the same manner, and lay upon the pink, pressing
all together. Trim the edges off smooth, leaving it in a nice,
square cake, then cut into slices or small cubes, as you prefer. It
is necessary to work it all up as rapidly as possible.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RASPBERRY CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Stir enough confectioners' sugar into a teaspoonful of raspberry
jam to form a thick paste; roll it into balls between the palms of
your hands. Put a lump of "French Cream" into a teacup and set it
into a basin of boiling water, stirring it until it has melted;
then drop a few drops of cochineal coloring to make it a pale pink,
or a few drops of raspberry juice, being careful not to add enough
to prevent its hardening.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg
450]</span><a name='Page_450' id="Page_450"></a> Now dip these
little balls into the sugar cream, giving them two coats. Lay aside
to harden.</p>
<p>Remember to <i>keep stirring</i> the melted cream, or if not it
will <i>turn back to clear syrup</i>.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NUT CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Chop almonds, hickory nuts, butternuts or English walnuts quite
fine. Make the '"French Cream," and before adding all the sugar,
while the cream is quite soft, stir into it the nuts, and then form
into balls, bars or squares. Several kinds of nuts may be mixed
together.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MAPLE SUGAR CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Grate fine maple sugar and mix, in quantity to suit the taste,
with "French Cream;" make any shape desired. Walnut creams are
sometimes made with maple sugar and are very fine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STICK CANDY.</b></p>
<p>One pound of granulated sugar, one cupful of water, a quarter of
a cupful of vinegar, or half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one
small tablespoonful of glycerine. Flavor with vanilla, rose or
lemon. Boil all except the flavoring, without stirring, twenty
minutes or half an hour, or until crisp when dropped in water. Just
before pouring upon greased platters to cool, add half a
teaspoonful of soda. After pouring upon platters to cool, pour two
teaspoonfuls of flavoring over the top. When partly cool, pull it
until very white. Draw it into sticks the size you wish, and cut
off with shears into sticks or kiss-shaped drops. It may be colored
if desired. (See page 444, for coloring.)</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of grated chocolate, two cupfuls of brown sugar, one
cupful of West India molasses, one cupful of milk or cream, butter
the size of an egg, boil until thick, <i>almost</i> brittle,
stirring constantly. Turn it out on to buttered plates, and when it
begins to stiffen, mark it in small squares so that it will break
easily when cold. Some like it flavored with a tablespoonful of
vanilla.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRILLED ALMONDS.</b></p>
<p>These are a very delicious candy seldom met with out of France.
They are rather more trouble to make than other kinds, but well
repay <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 451]</span><a name='Page_451' id=
"Page_451"></a>it from their novel flavor. Blanch a cupful of
almonds; dry them thoroughly. Boil a cupful of sugar and a quarter
of a cupful of water till it "hairs," then throw in the almonds;
let them fry, as it were, in this syrup, stirring them
occasionally; they will turn a faint yellow brown before the sugar
changes color; do not wait an instant once this change of color
begins, or they will lose flavor; remove them from the fire, and
stir them until the syrup has turned back to sugar and clings
irregularly to the nuts.</p>
<p>These are grilled almonds. You will find them delicious, as they
are to alternate at dinner with the salted almonds now so
fashionable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEPPERMINT DROPS.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of sugar crushed fine, and just moistened with
boiling water, then boiled five minutes; then take from the fire
and add cream of tartar the size of a pea; mix well and add four or
five drops of oil of peppermint. Beat briskly until the mixture
whitens, then drop quickly upon white paper. Have the cream of
tartar and oil of peppermint measured while the sugar is boiling.
If it sugars before it is all dropped, add a little water and boil
a minute or two.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRANT DROPS.</b></p>
<p>Use currant juice instead of water, to moisten a quantity of
sugar. Put it in a pan and heat, stirring constantly; be sure not
to let it boil; then mix a very little more sugar, let it warm with
the rest a moment, then, with a smooth stick, drop on paper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMON DROPS.</b></p>
<p>Upon a coffeecupful of finely powdered sugar pour just enough
lemon juice to dissolve it, and boil it to the consistency of thick
syrup, and so that it appears brittle when dropped in cold water.
Drop this on buttered plates in drops; set away to cool and
harden.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NUT MOLASSES CANDY.</b></p>
<p>When making molasses candy, add any kind of nuts you fancy; put
them in after the syrup has thickened and is ready to take from the
fire; pour out on buttered tins. Mark it off in squares before it
gets too cool. Peanuts should be fresh roasted and then tossed in a
sieve, to free them of their inner skins.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 452]</span><a name='Page_452' id=
"Page_452"></a>
<p><b>SUGAR NUT CANDY.</b></p>
<p>Three pounds of white sugar, half a pint of water, half a pint
of vinegar, a quarter of a pound of butter, one pound of hickory
nut kernels. Put the sugar, butter, vinegar and water together into
a thick saucepan. When it begins to thicken, add the nuts. To test
it, take up a very small quantity as quickly as possible directly
from the centre, taking care not to disturb it any more than is
necessary. Drop it into cold water, and remove from the fire the
moment the little particles are brittle. Pour into buttered plates.
Use any nuts with this recipe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT CANDY.</b></p>
<p>One cocoanut, one and one-half pounds of granulated sugar. Put
sugar and milk of cocoanut together, beat slowly until the sugar is
melted, then boil five minutes; add cocoanut (finely grated), boil
ten minutes longer, stir constantly to keep from burning. Pour on
buttered plates; cut in squares. Will take about two days to
harden. Use prepared cocoanut when other cannot be had.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BUTTER-SCOTCH.</b></p>
<p>Three cupfuls of white sugar, half a cupful of water, half a
cupful of vinegar, or half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a
tablespoonful of butter and eight drops of extract of lemon. Boil
<i>without stirring</i> till it will snap and break. Just before
taking from the fire, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of soda; pour
into well-buttered biscuit tins, a quarter of an inch thick. Mark
off into inch squares when partly cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EVERTON TAFFY, OR BUTTER-SCOTCH.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, two cupfuls of dark molasses, one cupful
of cold butter, grated rind of half a lemon. Boil over a slow fire
until it hardens when dropped in cold water. Pour thinly into tins
well buttered, and mark into inch squares before it cools.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MAPLE WALNUTS.</b></p>
<p>Beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth, stir in enough
powdered sugar to make it like hard frosting, dip the walnut meats
(which you have taken care to remove from the shells without
breaking) in a syrup made by boiling for two or three minutes two
tablespoonfuls of maple <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
453]</span><a name='Page_453' id="Page_453"></a>sugar in one of
water, or in this proportion. Press some of the hard frosting
between the two halves of the walnut and let it harden. Dates may
be prepared in this way, and butternuts and English walnuts
also.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POP-CORN CANDY. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Put into an iron kettle one tablespoonful of butter, three
tablespoonfuls of water and one cupful of white sugar; boil until
ready to candy, then throw in three quarts nicely popped corn; stir
vigorously until the sugar is evenly distributed over the corn;
take the kettle from the fire and stir until it cools a little, and
in this way you may have each kernel separate and all coated with
the sugar. Of course it must have your undivided attention from the
first, to prevent scorching. Almonds, English walnuts, or, in fact,
any nuts are delicious prepared in this way.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POP-CORN CANDY. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Having popped your corn, salt it and keep it warm, sprinkle over
with a whisk broom a mixture composed of an ounce of gum arabic and
a half pound of sugar, dissolved in two quarts of water; boil all a
few minutes. Stir the corn with the hands or large spoon
thoroughly; then mold into balls with the hands.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POP-CORN BALLS.</b></p>
<p>Take three large ears of pop-corn (rice is best). After popping,
shake it down in pan so the unpopped corn will settle at the
bottom; put the nice white popped in a greased pan. For the candy,
take one cup of molasses, one cup of light brown or white sugar,
one tablespoonful of vinegar. Boil until it will harden in water.
Pour on the corn. Stir with a spoon until thoroughly mixed; then
mold into balls with the hand.</p>
<p>No flavor should be added to this mixture, as the excellence of
this commodity depends entirely upon the united flavor of the corn,
salt and the sugar or molasses.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOARHOUND CANDY.</b></p>
<p>Boil two ounces of dried hoarhound in a pint and a half of water
for about half an hour; strain and add three and a half pounds of
brown sugar; boil over a hot fire until sufficiently hard; pour out
in <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 454]</span><a name='Page_454' id=
"Page_454"></a>flat, well-greased tins and mark into sticks or
small squares with a knife as soon as cool enough to retain its
shape.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JUJUBE PASTE.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, one-quarter of a pound of gum arabic, one
pint of water. Flavor with the essence of lemon and a grain of
cochineal. Let the mixture stand, until the gum is dissolved, in a
warm place on the back of the stove, then draw forward and cook
until thick; try in cold water; it should be limber and bend when
cold. Pour in buttered pans, an eighth of an inch thick; when cool,
roll up in a scroll.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANDIED ORANGES.</b></p>
<p>Candied orange is a great delicacy, which is easily made: Peel
and quarter the oranges; make a syrup in the proportion of one
pound of sugar to one pint of water; let it boil until it will
harden in water; then take it from the fire and dip the quarters of
orange in the syrup; let them drain on a fine sieve placed over a
platter so that the syrup will not be wasted; let them drain thus
until cool, when the sugar will crystallize. These are nice served
with the last course of dinner. Any fruit the same.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FIG CANDY.</b></p>
<p>One cup of sugar, one-third cup of water, one-fourth teaspoonful
cream of tartar. Do not stir while boiling. Boil to amber color,
stir in the cream of tartar just before taking from the fire. Wash
the figs, open and lay in a tin pan and pour the candy over them.
Or you may dip them in the syrup the same as "Candied Oranges."</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANDY ROLEY POLEY.</b></p>
<p>Take half a pint of citron, half a pint of raisins, half a pound
of figs, a quarter of a pound of shelled almonds, one pint of
peanuts before they are hulled; cut up the citron, stone the
raisins, blanch the almonds, and hull the peanuts; cut up the figs
into small bits. Take two pounds of coffee-sugar and moisten with
vinegar; put in a piece of butter as large as a walnut; stew till
it hardens, but take off before it gets to the brittle stage; beat
it with a spoon six or eight times, then stir in the mixed fruits
and nuts. Pour into a wet cloth and roll it up like a pudding,
twisting the ends of the cloth to mold it. Let it get cold and
slice off pieces as it may be wanted for eating.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 455]</span><a name='Page_455' id=
"Page_455"></a>
<p><b>MOLASSES CANDY.</b></p>
<p>Put one quart of West India molasses, one cupful of brown sugar,
a piece of butter the size of half an egg, into a six-quart kettle.
Let it boil over a slack fire until it begins to look thick,
stirring it often to prevent burning. Test it by taking some out
and dropping a few drops in a cup of cold water. If it hardens
quickly and breaks short between the teeth it is boiled enough. Now
put in half a teaspoonful of baking soda, and stir it well; then
pour it out into well-buttered flat tins. When partly cooled, take
up the candy with your hands well buttered then pull and double,
and so on, until the candy is a whitish yellow. It may be cut in
strips and rolled or twisted.</p>
<p>If flavoring is desired, drop the flavoring on the top as it
begins to cool and when it is pulled, the whole will be
flavored.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY CONSERVE.</b></p>
<p>Prepare the fruit as for preserving, allowing half a pound of
loaf sugar to one pound of fruit. Sprinkle the sugar over the fruit
at night; in the morning, put it on the fire in a kettle and boil
until the berries are clear. Spread on dishes and put in the sun
until dry; after which roll the fruit in sugar and pack in
jars.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH CONSERVE.</b></p>
<p>Halve the peaches and take out the stones; pare. Have ready some
powdered white sugar on a plate or dish. Roll the peaches in it
several times, until they will not take up any more. Place them
singly on a plate, with the cup or hollow side up, that the juices
may not run out. Lay them in the sun. The next morning roll them
again. As soon as the juice seems set in the peaches, turn the
other side to the sun. When they are thoroughly dry, pack them in
glass jars, or, what is still nicer, fig-drums. They make an
excellent sweetmeat just as they are; or, if wanted for table use,
put over the fire in porcelain, with a very little water, and stew
a few minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEACH LEATHER.</b></p>
<p>Stew as many peaches as you choose, allowing a quarter of a
pound of sugar to one of fruit; mash it up smooth as it cooks, and
when it is dry enough to spread in a thin sheet on a board greased
with butter, set it out in the sun to dry; when dry it can be
rolled up like <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 456]</span><a name=
'Page_456' id="Page_456"></a>leather, wrapped up in a cloth, and
will keep perfectly from season to season. School-children regard
it as a delightful addition to their lunch of biscuit or cold
bread. Apple and quince leather are made in the same fashion, only
a little flavoring or spice is added to them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT CARAMELS.</b></p>
<p>Two cupfuls of grated cocoanut, one cupful of sugar, two
tablespoonfuls of flour, the whites of three eggs, beaten stiff.
Soak the cocoanut, if desiccated, in milk enough to cover it; then
beat the whites of the eggs, add gradually the sugar, cocoanut and
flour; with your fingers make, by rolling the mixture, into cone
shapes. Place them on buttered sheets of tin covered with buttered
letter paper and bake in a moderate heat about fifteen or twenty
minutes. They should cool before removing from the tins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRIED PRESERVES.</b></p>
<p>Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be
converted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup
and then drying them slowly on the stove, strewing them thickly
with powdered sugar. They should be turned every few hours, sifting
over them more sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANDIES WITHOUT COOKING.</b></p>
<p>Very many candies made by confectioners are made without
boiling, which makes them very desirable, and they are equal to the
best "French Creams." The secret lies in the sugar used, which is
the <b>XXX</b> powdered or confectioners' sugar. Ordinary powdered
sugar, when rubbed between the thumb and finger has a decided
grain, but the confectioners' sugar is fine as flour. The candies
made after this process are better the day after.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRENCH VANILLA CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Break into a bowl the whites of one or more eggs, as the
quantity you wish to make will require; add to it an equal quantity
of cold water, then stir in XXX powdered or confectioners' sugar
until you have it stiff enough to mold into shape with the fingers.
Flavor with vanilla to taste. After it is formed in balls, cubes or
lozenge shapes, lay them upon plates or waxed paper and set them
aside to dry. This cream can be worked in candies similar to the
French cooked cream.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 457]</span><a name='Page_457' id=
"Page_457"></a>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE CREAM DROPS.</b></p>
<p>These are made or molded into cone-shape forms with the fingers,
from the uncooked "French Cream," similar to that which is cooked.
After forming into these little balls or cones, lay them on oiled
paper until the next day, to harden, or make them in the morning
and leave them until afternoon. Then melt some chocolate (the best
confectioners') in a basin set in another basin of boiling water;
when melted, and the creams are hard enough to handle, take one at
a time on a fork and drop into the melted chocolate, roll it until
well covered, then slip from the fork upon oiled or waxed paper,
and set them aside to harden.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT AND NUT CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Raisins seeded, currants, figs and citron, chopped fine, and
mixed with the uncooked "French Cream," while soft, before the
sugar is all mixed in, makes a delicious variety. Nuts also may be
mixed with this cream, stirring into it chopped almonds, hickory
nuts, butternuts, or English walnuts, then forming them into balls,
bars or squares. Several kinds of nuts may be mixed together.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGE DROPS.</b></p>
<p>Grate the rind of one orange and squeeze the juice, taking care
to reject the seeds; add to this a pinch of tartaric acid; then
stir in confectioners' sugar until it is stiff enough to form into
balls the size of a small marble. This is delicious candy.</p>
<p>The same process for lemon drops, using lemons in place of
orange. Color a faint yellow.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOANUT CREAMS.</b></p>
<p>Make the uncooked cream as in the foregoing recipe. Take the
cream while soft, add fresh grated cocoanut to taste; add
sufficient confectioners' sugar to mold into balls and then roll
the balls in the fresh grated cocoanut. These may be colored pink
with a few drops of cochineal syrup, also brown by adding a few
spoonfuls of grated chocolate; then rolling them in grated
cocoanut; the three colors are very pretty together. The coconut
cream may be made into a flat cake and cut into squares or
strips.</p>
<p>With this uncooked cream, all the recipes given for the cooked
"French Cream," may be used: English walnut creams, variegated
creams, etc.</p>

<h2><b>COFFEE, TEA, BEVERAGES.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Boiling water is a very important desideratum in the making of a
cup of good coffee or tea, but the average housewife is very apt to
overlook this fact. Do not boil the water more than three or four
minutes; longer boiling ruins the water for coffee or tea making,
as most of its natural properties escape by evaporation, leaving a
very insipid liquid composed mostly of lime and iron, that would
ruin the best coffee, and give the tea a dark, dead look, which
ought to be the reverse.</p>
<p>Water left in the tea-kettle over night <i>must never be used
for preparing the breakfast coffee</i>; no matter how excellent
your coffee or tea may be, it will be ruined by the addition of
water that has been boiled more than once.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE HEALING PROPERTIES OF TEA AND COFFEE.</b></p>
<p>The medical properties of these two beverages are considerable.
Tea is used advantageously in inflammatory diseases and as a cure
for the headache. Coffee is supposed to act as a preventative of
gravel and gout, and to its influence is ascribed the rarity of
those diseases in Prance and Turkey. Both tea and coffee powerfully
counteract the effects of opium and intoxicating liquors: though,
when taken in excess, and without nourishing food, they themselves
produce, temporarily at least, some of the more disagreeable
consequences incident to the use of ardent spirits. In general,
however, none but persons possessing great mobility of the nervous
system, or enfeebled or effeminate constitutions, are injuriously
affected by the moderate use of tea and coffee in connection with
food.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COFFEE.</b></p>
<p>One full coffeecupful of ground coffee, stirred with one egg and
part of the shell, adding a half cupful of <i>cold</i> water. Put
it into the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 459]</span><a name='Page_459'
id="Page_459"></a>coffee boiler, and pour on to it a quart of
boiling water; as it rises and begins to boil, stir it down with a
silver spoon or fork. Boil hard for ten or twelve minutes. Remove
from the fire and pour out a cupful of coffee, then pour back into
the coffeepot. Place it on the back of the stove or range where it
will keep hot (and not boil); it will settle in about five minutes.
Send to the table <i>hot</i>. Serve with good cream and lump sugar.
Three-quarters of a pound of Java and a quarter of a pound of Mocha
make the best mixture of coffee.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VIENNA COFFEE.</b></p>
<p>Equal parts of Mocha and Java coffee; allow one heaping
tablespoonful of coffee to each person and two extra to make good
strength. Mix one egg with grounds; pour on coffee half as much
boiling water as will be needed; let it froth, then stir down
grounds, and let boil five minutes; then let it stand where it will
keep hot, but not boil, for five or ten minutes, and add rest of
water. To one pint of cream add the white of an egg, well beaten;
this is to be put in cups with sugar, and hot coffee added.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FILTERED OR DRIP COFFEE.</b></p>
<p>For each person allow a large tablespoonful of finely ground
coffee, and to every tablespoonful allow a cupful of boiling water;
the coffee to be one part Mocha to two of Java.</p>
<p>Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffeepot
inside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the
purpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into the pot, pour some
boiling water in it, and, when the pot is well warmed, put the
ground coffee into the bag; pour over as much boiling water as is
required, close the lid, and, when all the water has filtered
through, remove the bag, and send the coffee to table. Making it in
this manner prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one
vessel to another, which cools and spoils it. The water should be
poured on the coffee gradually so that the infusion may be
stronger; and the bag must be well made that none of the grounds
may escape through the seams and so make the coffee thick and
muddy.</p>
<p>Patented coffeepots on this principle can be purchased at most
house-furnishing stores.</p>

<p><b>ICED COFFEE.</b></p>
<p>Make more coffee than usual at breakfast time and stronger. When
cold put on ice. Serve with cracked ice in each tumbler.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUBSTITUTE FOR CREAM IN COFFEE.</b></p>
<p>Beat the white of an egg, put to it a small lump of butter and
pour the coffee into it gradually, stirring it so that it will not
curdle. It is difficult to distinguish this from fresh cream.</p>
<p>Many drop a tiny piece of sweet butter into their cup of hot
coffee as a substitute for cream.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE TEA.</b></p>
<p>Allow two teaspoonfuls of tea to one large cupful of boiling
water. Scald the teapot, put in the tea, pour on about a cupful of
<i>boiling</i> water, set it on the fire in a warm place, where it
will not boil, but keep very hot, to almost boiling; let it steep
or "draw" ten or twelve minutes. Now fill up with as much boiling
water as is required. Send <i>hot</i> to the table. It is better to
use a china or porcelain teapot, but if you do use metal let it be
tin, new, bright and clean; never use it when the tin is worn off
and the iron exposed. If you do you are drinking tea-ate of
iron.</p>
<p>To make tea to perfection, boiling water must be poured on the
leaves directly it boils. Water which has been boiling more than
five minutes, or which has previously boiled, should on no account
be used. If the water does not boil, or if it be allowed to
overboil, the leaves of the tea will be only half-opened and the
tea itself will be quite spoiled. The water should be allowed to
remain on the leaves from ten to fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>A Chinese being interviewed for the <i>Cook</i> says: Drink your
tea plain. Don't add milk or sugar. Tea-brokers and tea-tasters
never do; epicures never do; the Chinese never do. Milk contains
fibrin, albumen or some other stuff, and the tea a delicate amount
of tannin. Mixing the two makes the liquid turbid. This turbidity,
if I remember the cyclop&aelig;dia aright, is tannate of fibrin, or
leather. People who put milk in tea are therefore drinking boots
and shoes in mild disguise.</p>

<p><b>ICED TEA.</b></p>
<p>Is now served to a considerable extent during the summer months.
It is of course used without milk, and the addition of sugar serves
only to destroy the finer tea flavor. It may be prepared some hours
in advance, and should be made stronger than when served hot. It is
bottled and placed in the ice chest till required. Use the black or
green teas, or both, mixed, as fancied.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHOCOLATE.</b></p>
<p>Allow half a cupful of grated chocolate to a pint of water and a
pint of milk. Rub the chocolate smooth in a little cold water and
stir into the boiling water. Boil twenty minutes, add the milk and
boil ten minutes more, stirring it often. Sweeten to your
taste.</p>
<p>The French put two cupfuls of boiling water to each cupful of
chocolate. They throw in the chocolate just as the water commences
to boil. Stir it with a spoon as soon as it boils up, add two
cupfuls of good milk, and when it has boiled sufficiently, serve a
spoonful of thick whipped cream with each cup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COCOA.</b></p>
<p>Six tablespoonfuls of cocoa to each pint of water, as much milk
as water, sugar to taste. Rub cocoa smooth in a little cold water;
have ready on the fire a pint of boiling water; stir in grated
cocoa paste. Boil twenty minutes, add milk and boil five minutes
more, stirring often. Sweeten in cups so as to suit different
tastes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BUTTERMILK AS A DRINK.</b></p>
<p>Buttermilk, so generally regarded as a waste product, has
latterly been coming somewhat into vogue, not only as a nutrient,
but as a therapeutic agent, and in an editorial article the
<i>Canada Lancet</i>, some time ago, highly extolled its virtues.
Buttermilk may be roughly described as milk which has lost most of
its fat and a small percentage of casein, and which has become sour
by fermentation. Long experience has demonstrated it to be an agent
of superior digestibility. It is, indeed, a true milk
peptone&mdash;that is, milk already partly digested, the
coagulation of the coagulable portion being loose and flaky, and
not of that firm indigestible nature which is the result of the
action of the gastric juice upon cow's sweet milk. It resembles
koumiss in its <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 462]</span><a name=
'Page_462' id="Page_462"></a>nature, and, with the exception of
that article, it is the most grateful, refreshing and digestible of
the products of milk. It is a decided laxative to the bowels, a
fact which must be borne in mind in the treatment of typhoid fever,
and which may be turned to advantage in the treatment of habitual
constipation. It is a diuretic, and may be prescribed with
advantage in some kidney troubles. Owing to its acidity, combined
with its laxative properties, it is believed to exercise a general
impression on the liver. It is well adapted to many cases where it
is customary to recommend lime water and milk. It is invaluable in
the treatment of diabetes, either exclusively, or alternating with
skimmed milk. In some cases of gastric ulcer and cancer of the
stomach, it is the only food that can be retained.</p>

<p><b>CURRANT WINE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>The currants should be quite ripe. Stem, mash and strain them,
adding a half pint of water and less than a pound of sugar to a
quart of the mashed fruit. Stir well up together and pour into a
clean cask, leaving the bung-hole open, or covered with a piece of
lace. It should stand for a month to ferment, when it will be ready
for bottling; just before bottling you may add a small quantity of
brandy or whisky.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURRANT WINE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>To each quart of currant juice, add two quarts of soft water and
three pounds of brown sugar. Put into a jug or small keg, leaving
the top open until fermentation ceases and it looks clear. Draw off
and cork tightly.</p>

<br>
<p><b>BLACKBERRY WINE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Cover your blackberries with cold water; crush the berries well
with a wooden masher; let them stand twenty-four hours; then
strain, and to one gallon of juice put three pounds of common brown
sugar; put into wide-mouthed jars for several days, carefully
skimming off the scum that will rise to the top; put in several
sheets of brown paper and let them remain in it three days; then
skim again and pour through a funnel into your cask. There let it
remain undisturbed till March; then strain again and bottle. These
directions, if carefully followed out, will insure you excellent
wine.</p>

<p><b>BLACKBERRY WINE NO. 2</b></p>
<p>Berries should be ripe and plump. Put into a large wood or stone
vessel with a tap; pour on sufficient boiling water to cover them;
when cool enough to bear your hand, bruise well until all the
berries are broken; cover up, let stand until berries begin to rise
to top, which will occur in three or four days. Then draw off the
clear juice in another vessel, and add one pound of sugar to every
ten quarts of the liquor, and stir thoroughly. Let stand six to ten
days in first vessel with top; then draw off through a jelly-bag.
Steep four ounces of isinglass in a pint of wine for twelve hours;
boil it over a slow fire till all dissolved, then place dissolved
isinglass in a gallon of blackberry juice, give them a boil
together and pour all into the vessel. Let stand a few days to
ferment and settle; draw off and keep in a cool place. Other berry
wines may be made in the same manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRAPE WINE.</b></p>
<p>Mash the grapes and strain them through a cloth; put the skins
in a tub, after squeezing them, with barely enough water to cover
them; strain the juice thus obtained into the first portion; put
three pounds of sugar to one gallon of the mixture; let it stand in
an open tub to ferment, covered with a cloth, for a period of from
three to seven days; skim off what rises every morning. Put the
juice in a cask and leave it open for twenty-four hours; then bung
it up, and put clay over the bung to keep the air out. Let your
wine remain in the cask until March, when it should be drawn off
and bottled.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLORIDA ORANGE WINE.</b></p>
<p>Wipe the oranges with a wet cloth, peel off the yellow rind very
thin, squeeze the oranges, and strain the juice through a
hair-sieve; measure the juice after it is strained and for each
gallon allow three pounds of granulated sugar, the white and shell
of one egg and one-third of a gallon of cold water; put the sugar,
the white and shell of the egg (crushed small) and the water over
the fire and stir them every two minutes until the eggs begin to
harden; then boil the syrup until it looks clear under the froth,
of egg which will form on the surface; strain the syrup, pour it
upon the orange rind and let it stand over night; then next add the
orange juice and again let it stand over <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
464]</span><a name='Page_464' id="Page_464"></a>night; strain it
the second day, and put it into a tight cask with a small cake of
compressed yeast to about ten gallons of wine, and leave the bung
out of the cask until the wine ceases to ferment; the hissing noise
continues so long as fermentation is in progress; when fermentation
ceases, close the cask by driving in the bung, and let the wine
stand about nine months before bottling it; three months after it
is bottled, it can be used. A glass of brandy added to each gallon
of wine after fermentation ceases is generally considered an
improvement.</p>
<p>There are seasons of the year when Florida oranges by the box
are very cheap, and this fine wine can be made at a small
expense.</p>
<br>
<p><b>METHELIN, OR HONEY WINE.</b></p>
<p>This is a very ancient and popular drink in the north of Europe.
To some new honey, strained, add spring water; put a whole egg into
it; boil this liquor till the egg swims above the liquor; strain,
pour it in a cask. To every fifteen gallons add two ounces of white
Jamaica ginger, bruised, one ounce of cloves and mace, one and
one-half ounces of cinnamon, all bruised together and tied up in a
muslin bag; accelerate the fermentation with yeast; when worked
sufficiently, bung up; in six weeks draw off into bottles.</p>
<p><i>Another Mead.</i>&mdash;Boil the combs, from which the honey
has been drained, with sufficient water to make a tolerably sweet
liquor; ferment this with yeast and proceed as per previous
formula.</p>
<p><i>Sack Mead</i> is made by adding a handful of hops and
sufficient brandy to the comb liquor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLACK CURRANT WINE.</b></p>
<p>Four quarts of whisky, four quarts of black currants, four
pounds of brown or white sugar, one tablespoonful of cloves, one
tablespoonful of cinnamon.</p>
<p>Crush the currants and let them stand in the whisky with the
spices for three weeks; then strain and add the sugar; set away
again for three weeks longer; then strain and bottle.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RAISIN WINE.</b></p>
<p>Take two pounds of raisins, seed and chop them, a lemon, a pound
of white sugar and about two gallons of boiling water. Pour into a
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 465]</span><a name='Page_465' id=
"Page_465"></a>stone jar and stir daily for six or eight days.
Strain, bottle and put in a cool place for ten days or so, when the
wine will be ready for use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHERRY BOUNCE.</b></p>
<p>To one gallon of wild cherries add enough good whisky to cover
the fruit. Let soak two or three weeks and then drain off the
liquor. Mash the cherries without breaking the stones and strain
through a jelly-bag; add this liquor to that already drained off.
Make a with a gill of water and a pound of white sugar to every two
of liquor thus prepared; stir in well and bottle, and tightly cork.
A common way of making cherry bounce is to put wild cherries and
whisky together in a jug and use the liquor as wanted.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLACKBERRY CORDIAL.</b></p>
<p>Warm and squeeze the berries; add to one pint of juice one pound
of white sugar, one-half ounce of powdered cinnamon, one-fourth
ounce of mace, two teaspoonfuls of cloves. Boil all together for
one-fourth of an hour; strain the syrup, and to each pint add a
glass of French brandy. Two or three doses of a tablespoonful or
less will check any slight diarrhoea. When the attack is violent,
give a tablespoonful after each discharge until the complaint is in
subjection. It will arrest dysentery if given in season, and is a
pleasant and safe remedy. Excellent for children when teething.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOP BEER.</b></p>
<p>Take five quarts of water, six ounces of hops, boil it three
hours; then strain the liquor, add to it five quarts of water, four
ounces of bruised ginger root; boil this again twenty minutes,
strain and add four pounds of sugar. When luke-warm put in a pint
of yeast. Let it ferment; in twenty-four hours it will be ready for
bottling.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GINGER BEER.</b></p>
<p>Put into a kettle two ounces of powdered ginger root (or more if
it is not very strong), half an ounce of cream of tartar, two large
lemons, cut in slices, two pounds of broken loaf sugar and two
gallons of soft boiling water. Simmer them over a slow fire for
half an hour. When the liquor is nearly cold, stir into it a large
tablespoonful of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 466]</span><a name=

fermented, which will be in about twenty-four hours, bottle for
use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPRUCE BEER.</b></p>
<p>Allow an ounce of hops and a spoonful of ginger to a gallon of
water. When well boiled, strain it and put in a pint of molasses,
or a pound of brown sugar, and half an ounce or less of the essence
of spruce; when cool, add a teacupful of yeast, and put into a
clean tight cask, and let it ferment for a day or two, then bottle
it for use. You can boil the sprigs of spruce fir in place of the
essence.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROMAN PUNCH. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Grate the yellow rind of four lemons and two oranges upon two
pounds of loaf sugar. Squeeze the juice of the lemons and oranges;
cover it and let it stand until next day. Strain it through a
sieve, mix with the sugar; add a bottle of champagne and the whites
of eight eggs beaten to a stiff froth. It may be frozen or not, as
desired. For winter use snow instead of ice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ROMAN PUNCH. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Make two quarts of lemonade, rich with pure juice lemon fruit;
add one tablespoonful of extract of lemon. Work well and freeze;
just before serving, add for each quart of ice half a pint of
brandy and half a pint of Jamaica rum. Mix well and serve in high
glasses, as this makes what is called a semi or half ice. It is
usually served at dinners as a <i>coup de milieu</i>.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DELICIOUS JUNKET.</b></p>
<p>Take two quarts of new milk, warm it on the stove to about blood
heat, pour it into a glass or china bowl and stir into it two
tablespoonfuls of prepared rennet, two tablespoonfuls of powdered
loaf sugar, and a small wine-glassful of pale brandy. Let it stand
till cold and eat with sugar and rich cream. Half the quantity can
be made.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RASPBERRY SHRUB.</b></p>

<p><b>SASSAFRAS MEAD.</b></p>
<p>Mix gradually with two quarts of boiling water three pounds and
a half of the best brown sugar, a pint and a half of good West
India molasses, and a quarter of a pound of tartaric acid. Stir it
well and when cool, strain it into a large jug or pan, then mix in
a teaspoonful (not more) of essence of sassafras. Transfer it to
clean bottles (it will fill about half a dozen), cork it tightly
and keep it in a cool place. It will be fit for use next day. Put
into a box or boxes a quarter of a pound of carbonate of soda, to
use with it. To prepare a glass of sassafras mead for drinking, put
a large tablespoonful of the mead into half a tumbler full of
ice-water, stir into it a half teaspoonful of the soda and it will
immediately foam up to the top.</p>
<p>Sassafras mead will be found a cheap, wholesome and pleasant
beverage for warm weather. The essence of sassafras, tartaric acid
and carbonate of soda, can, of course, be obtained at the
druggist's.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CREAM SODA WITHOUT THE FOUNTAIN.</b></p>
<p>Coffee-sugar, four pounds, three pints of water, three nutmegs,
grated, the whites of ten eggs, well beaten, gum arabic, one ounce,
twenty drops of oil of lemon, or extract equal to that amount. By
using oils or other fruits, you can make as many flavors from this
as you desire. Mix all and place over a gentle fire, and stir well
about thirty minutes; remove from the fire and strain, and divide
into two parts; into one-half put eight ounces of bicarbonate of
soda, into the other half put six ounces of tartaric acid. Shake
well, and when cold they are ready for use by pouring three or four
spoonfuls from both parts into separate glasses, each one-third
full of water. Stir each and pour together, and you have a nice
glass of cream soda which you can drink at your leisure, as the gum
and eggs hold the gas.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WINE WHEY.</b></p>
<p>Sweeten one pint of milk to taste, and when boiling, throw in
two wine-glasses of sherry; when the curd forms, strain the whey
through a muslin bag into tumblers.</p>

<p><b>LEMON SYRUP.</b></p>
<p>Take the juice of twelve lemons; grate the rind of six in it,
let it stand over night; then take six pounds of white sugar and
make a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 468]</span><a name='Page_468' id=
"Page_468"></a>thick syrup. When it is quite cool, strain the juice
into it, and squeeze as much oil from the grated rind as will suit
the taste. Put in bottles, securely corked, for future use. A
tablespoonful in a goblet of water will make a delicious drink on a
hot day.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FOR A SUMMER DRAUGHT.</b></p>
<p>The juice of one lemon, a tumblerful of cold water, pounded
sugar to taste, half a small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.
Squeeze the juice from the lemon; strain and add it to the water,
with sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. When
well mixed, put in the soda, stir well and drink while the mixture
is in an effervescing state.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NOYEAU CORDIAL.</b></p>
<p>To one gallon of proof spirit add three pounds of loaf sugar and
a tablespoonful of extract of almonds. Mix well together and allow
to stand forty-eight hours; covered closely; now strain through
thick flannel and bottle. This liquor will be much improved by
adding half a pint of apricot or peach juice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGG NOG.</b></p>
<p>Beat the yolks of twelve eggs very light, stir in as much white
sugar as they will dissolve, pour in gradually one glass of brandy
to cook the egg, one glass of old whisky, one grated nutmeg, and
three pints of rich milk. Beat the whites to a froth and stir in
last.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGG FLIP, OR MULLED ALE.</b></p>
<p>Boil one quart of good ale with some nutmeg; beat up six eggs

twenty-four hours in a quart of brandy or rum. Then mix with it the
juice of the lemons, a pound and a half of loaf sugar, two grated
nutmegs and a quart of water. Add a quart of rich unskimmed milk,
made boiling hot, and strain the whole through a jelly-bag. You may
either use it as soon as it is cold, or make a larger quantity (in
the above proportions) and bottle it. It will keep several
months.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE HOT PUNCH.</b></p>
<p>Half a pint of rum, half a pint of brandy, quarter of a pound of
sugar, one large lemon, half a teaspoonful of nutmeg, one pint of
boiling water.</p>
<p>Rub the sugar over the lemon until it has absorbed all the
yellow part of the skin, then put the sugar into a punch bowl; add
the lemon juice (free from pips) and mix these two ingredients,
well together. Pour over them the boiling water, stir well
together, add the rum, brandy and nutmeg; mix thoroughly and the
punch will be ready to serve. It is very important in making good
punch that all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated; and to
insure success, the processes of mixing must be diligently attended
to. (This is an old-style punch.)</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEMONADE.</b></p>
<p>Three lemons to a pint of water makes strong lemonade; sweeten

<p><b>STRAWBERRY WATER.</b></p>
<p>Take one cupful of ripe hulled berries; crush with a wooden
spoon, mixing with the mass a quarter of a pound of pulverized
sugar and half a pint of cold water. Pour the mixture into a fine
sieve, rub through and filter till clear; add the strained juice,
of one lemon and one and a half pints of cold water, mix thoroughly
and set in ice chest till wanted.</p>
<p>This makes a nice, cool drink on a warm day and easily to be
made in strawberry season.</p>
<p><b>STRAWBERRY AND RASPBERRY SYRUP.</b></p>
<p>Mash the fresh fruit, express the juice and to each quart add
three and a half pounds of granulated sugar. The juice, heated to
180&deg; <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 470]</span><a name='Page_470'
id="Page_470"></a>Fahrenheit, and strained or filtered previous to
dissolving the sugar, will keep for an indefinite time, canned hot
in glass jars.</p>
<p>The juice of soft fruits is best when allowed to drop therefrom
by its own weight; lightly mash the fruit and then suspend in a
cloth, allowing the juice to drop in a vessel beneath. Many
housekeepers, after the bottles and jars are thoroughly washed and
dried, smoke them with sulphur in this way: Take a piece of wire
and bend it around a small piece of brimstone the size of a bean;
set the brimstone on fire, put it in the jar or bottle, bending the
other end over the mouth of the vessel, and cover with a cork;
after the brimstone has burned away, fill the vessel with the syrup
or preserves and cover tightly. There is no sulphurous taste left
by the process.</p>
<br>
<p><b>KOUMISS.</b></p>
<p>Koumiss is prepared by dissolving four ounces of white sugar in
one gallon of skimmed milk, and placing in bottles of the capacity
of one quart; add two ounces of baker's yeast or a cake of
compressed yeast to each bottle. Cork and tie securely, set in a
warm place until fermentation is well under way, and lay the
bottles on their sides in a cool cellar. In three days,
fermentation will have progressed sufficiently to permit the
koumiss to be in good condition.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PINEAPPLE VINEGAR.</b></p>
<p>Cover sliced pineapples with pure cider vinegar; let them stand
three or four days, then mash and strain through a cloth as long as
it runs clear; to every three quarts of juice add five pounds of
sugar.</p>
<p>Boil it altogether about ten minutes, skim carefully until
nothing rises to the surface, take from the fire; when cool, bottle
it. Blackberries and raspberries, and, in fact, any kind of highly
flavored fruit, is fine; a tablespoonful in a glass of ice-cold
water, to drink in warm weather.</p>
<p><b>RASPBERRY VINEGAR. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>Put a quart of raspberries into a suitable dish, pour over them
a quart of good vinegar, let it stand twenty-four hours, then
strain through a flannel bag and pour this liquor on another quart
of berries; do this for three or four days successively and strain
it; make it very sweet with loaf sugar; bottle and seal it.</p>

<br>
<p><b>HOME-MADE TABLE VINEGAR.</b></p>
<p>Put in an open cask four gallons of warm rain-water, one gallon
of common molasses and two quarts of yeast; cover the top with thin
muslin and leave it in the sun, covering it up at night and when it
rains. In three or four weeks it will be good vinegar. If cider can
be used in place of rain-water the vinegar will make much
sooner&mdash;will not take over a week to make a very sharp
vinegar. Excellent for pickling purposes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VERY STRONG TABLE VINEGAR.</b></p>
<p>Take two gallons of good cider and thoroughly mix it with two
pounds of new honey, pour into your cask or bottle and let it stand
from four to six months, when you will have vinegar so strong that
it cannot be used at table without diluting with water. It is the
best ever procured for pickling purposes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PINEAPPLE-ADE.</b></p>
<p>Pare and slice some very ripe pineapples; then cut the slices
into small pieces. Put them with all their juice into a large
pitcher, and sprinkle among them plenty of powdered white sugar.
Pour on boiling water, allowing a small half pint to each
pineapple. Cover the pitcher and let it stand till quite cool,
occasionally pressing down the pineapple with a spoon. Then set the
pitcher for a while in ice. Lastly, strain the infusion into
another vessel and transfer it to tumblers, putting into each glass
some more sugar and a bit of ice. This beverage will be found
delicious.</p>

<p>Fold in a white paper a mixture of one drachm of Rochelle salts
and twenty-five grains of carbonate of soda, in a blue paper twenty
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 472]</span><a name='Page_472' id=
"Page_472"></a>grains of tartaric acid. They should all be
pulverized very finely. Put the contents of the white paper into a
tumbler, not quite half full of cold water, and stir it till
dissolved. Then put the mixture from the blue paper into another
tumbler with the same quantity of water, and stir that also. When
the powders are dissolved in both tumblers, pour the first into the
other, and it will effervesce immediately. Drink it quickly, while
foaming.</p>
<br>
<p><b>INEXPENSIVE DRINK.</b></p>
<p>A very nice, cheap drink which may take the place of lemonade
and be found fully as healthful is made with one cupful of pure
cider vinegar, half a cupful of good molasses, put into one quart
pitcher of ice-water. A tablespoonful of ground ginger added makes
a healthful beverage.</p>

<h2>MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTION<br>
OF<br>
DINNERS AND RECEPTIONS<br>
ON<br>
STATE OCCASIONS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.</h2>
<p>Etiquette as observed in European courts is not known at the
White House.</p>
<p>The President's Secretary issues invitations by direction of the
President to the distinguished guests.</p>
<p>The Usher in charge of the cloak-room hands to the gentleman on
arrival an envelope containing a diagram of the table (as cut
shows), whereon the name and seat of the respective guest and the
lady he is to escort to dinner are marked.</p>
<center><img src='images/507.png' width='400' height='232' alt=''
title=''></center>
<p>A card corresponding with his name is placed on the napkin
belonging to the cover of the seat he will occupy.</p>
<p>The President's seat is in the middle of the table. The most
distinguished guests sit on his right and left. If their wives are
present they will occupy these seats, and the gentlemen will be
seated next to the President's wife whose seat is directly opposite
the President.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 508]</span><a name='Page_508' id=
"Page_508"></a>
<p>Official dinners all over the world are always served after the
French fashion, and are divided into three distinct parts. Two of
them are served from the kitchen, and the third from the
pantry.</p>
<p>The first part of the dinner served French style includes from
oysters on the shell to the sherbets.</p>
<p>The second service continues to the sweet dishes.</p>
<p>The third includes ice, cakes, fruits, cheeses, which are all
understood as desserts, and are dressed in the pantry.</p>
<p>All principal dishes which are artistically decorated are shown
to the President first, then are carried around the table before
being carved by the Steward in the pantry.</p>
<p>Fancy folding of the napkins is considered out of fashion; plain
square folded, so as to show monogram in the middle, is much
preferred.</p>
<p>The following diagram will illustrate the arrangement of the
glasses on the table. (See diagram.)</p>

<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 509]</span><a name='Page_509' id=

<p>Corsage boquets for ladies consist of not more than eight large
roses tied together by silk ribbon, with the name of the lady

<a name='FOR_THE_SICK' id="FOR_THE_SICK"></a>
<h2><b>FOR THE SICK.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Dishes for invalids should be served in the daintiest and most
attractive way; never send more than a supply for one meal; the
same dish too frequently set before an invalid often causes a
distaste, when perhaps a change would tempt the appetite.</p>
<p>When preparing dishes where milk is used, the condition of the
patient should be considered. Long cooking hardens the albumen and
makes the milk very constipating; then, if the patient should be
already constipated, care should be taken not to heat the milk
above the boiling point.</p>
<p>The seasoning of food for the sick should be varied according to
the condition of the patient; one recovering from illness can
partake of a little piece of roast mutton, chicken, rabbit, game,
fish, simply dressed, and simple puddings are all light food and
easily digested. A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed and broiled, is
a dish that is often inviting to an invalid. As a rule, an invalid
will be more likely to enjoy any preparation sent to him if it is
served in small delicate pieces. As there are so many small, dainty
dishes that can be made for this purpose, it seems useless to try
to give more than a small variety of them. Pudding can be made of
prepared barley, or tapioca, well soaked before boiling, with an
egg added, and a change can be made of light puddings by mixing up
some stewed fruit with the puddings before baking; a bread pudding
from stale bread crumbs, and a tiny cup-custard, boiled in a small
basin or cup; also various drinks, such as milk punch, wine, whey,
apple-toddy, and various other nourishing drinks.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEFSTEAK AND MUTTON CHOPS.</b></p>
<p>Select the tenderest cuts and broil over a clear, hot fire. Let
the steak be rare, the chops well done. Salt and pepper, lay
between two <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 511]</span><a name='Page_511'
id="Page_511"></a><i>hot</i> plates three minutes and serve to your
patient. If he is very weak do not let him swallow anything except
the juice, when he has chewed the meat well. The essence of rare
beef, roasted or broiled, thus expressed, is considered by some
physicians to be more strengthening than beef tea prepared in the
usual manner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEEF TEA.</b></p>
<p>One pound of <i>lean</i> beef, cut into small pieces. Put into a
glass canning jar, without a drop of water, cover tightly and set
in a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil and continue this
steadily for three or four hours, until the meat is like white rags
and the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to taste and, when
cold, skim.</p>
<br>
<p><b>VEAL OR MUTTON BROTH.</b></p>
<p>Take a scrag-end of mutton (two pounds), put it in a saucepan
with two quarts of cold water and an ounce of pearl barley or rice.
When it is coming to a boil, skim it well, then add half a
teaspoonful of salt; let it boil until half reduced, then strain it
and take off all the fat and it is ready for use. This is excellent
for an invalid. If vegetables are liked in this broth, take one
turnip, one carrot and one onion, cut them in shreds and boil them
in the broth half an hour. In that case, the barley may be served
with the vegetables in broth.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN BROTH.</b></p>
<p>Make the same as mutton or beef broth. Boil the chicken slowly,
putting on just enough water to cover it well, watching it closely
that it does not boil down too much. When the chicken is tender,
season with salt and a very little pepper. The yolk of an egg
beaten light and added, is very nourishing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OATMEAL GRUEL.</b></p>
<p>Put four tablespoonfuls of the best grits (oatmeal coarsely
ground) into a pint of boiling water. Let it boil gently, and stir
it often, till it becomes as thick as you wish it. Then strain it,
and add to it while warm, butter, wine, nutmeg, or whatever is
thought proper to flavor it. Salt to taste.</p>
<p>If you make a gruel of fine oatmeal, sift it, mix it first to a
thick batter with a little cold water, and then put it into the
saucepan of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 512]</span><a name='Page_512'
id="Page_512"></a>boiling water. Stir it all the time it is
boiling, lifting the spoon gently up and down, and letting the
gruel fall slowly back again into the pan.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CORN MEAL GRUEL.</b></p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of fine Indian meal, mixed smooth with cold
water, and a saltspoonful of salt; add one quart of boiling water
and cook twenty minutes. Stir it frequently, and if it becomes too
thick use boiling water to thin it. If the stomach is not too weak,
a tablespoonful of cream may be used to cool it. Some like it
sweetened and others like it plain. For very sick persons, let it
settle, pour off the top, and give without other seasoning. For
convalescents, toast a piece of bread as nicely as possible, and
put it in the gruel with a tablespoonful of nice sweet cream and a
little ginger and sugar. This should be used only when a laxative
is allowed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGG GRUEL.</b></p>
<p>Beat the yolk of an egg with one tablespoonful of sugar; pour
one teacupful of boiling water on it, add the white of an egg,
beaten to a froth, with any seasoning or spice desired. Take
warm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MILK PORRIDGE.</b></p>
<p>The same as arrowroot, excepting it should be all milk, and
thickened with a scant tablespoonful of sifted flour; let it boil
five minutes, stirring it constantly, add a little cold milk, give
it one boil up, and it is ready for use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ARROWROOT MILK PORRIDGE.</b></p>
<p>One large cupful of fresh milk, new if you can get it, one
cupful of boiling water, one teaspoonful of arrowroot, wet to a
paste with sold water, two teaspoonfuls of white sugar, a pinch of
salt. Put the sugar into the milk, the salt into the boiling water,
which should be poured into a farina kettle. Add the wet arrowroot
and boil, stirring constantly until it is clear; put in the milk
and cook ten minutes, stirring often. Give while warm, adding hot
milk should it be thicker than gruel.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ARROWROOT BLANC MANGE.</b></p>
<p>One large cupful of boiling milk, one even tablespoonful of
arrowroot rubbed to a paste with cold water, two teaspoonfuls of
white <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 513]</span><a name='Page_513' id=
"Page_513"></a>sugar, a pinch of salt, flavor with rose-water.
Proceed as in the foregoing recipes, boiling and stirring eight
minutes. Turn into a wet mold, and, when firm, serve with cream and
powdered sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TAPIOCA JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Soak a cupful of tapioca in a quart of cold water after washing
it thoroughly two or three times; after soaking three or four
hours, simmer it in a stewpan until it becomes quite clear,
stirring often; add the juice of a lemon, and a little of the
grated peel, also a pinch of salt. Sweeten to taste. Wine can be
substituted for lemon, if liked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SLIPPERY-ELM BARK TEA.</b></p>
<p>Break the bark into bits, pour boiling water over it, cover and
let it infuse until cold. Sweeten, ice, and take for summer
disorders, or add lemon juice and drink for a bad cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLAX-SEED TEA.</b></p>
<p>Upon an ounce of unbruised flax-seed and a little pulverized
liquorice-root pour a pint of boiling (soft or rain) water, and
place the vessel containing these ingredients near, but not on, the
fire for four hours. Strain through a linen cloth. Make it fresh
every day. An excellent drink in fever accompanied by a cough.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLAX-SEED LEMONADE.</b></p>
<p>To a large tablespoonful of flax-seed, allow a tumbler and a
half of cold water. Boil them together till the liquid becomes very
sticky. Then strain it hot over a quarter of a pound of pulverized
sugar, and an ounce of pulverized gum arabic. Stir it till quite
dissolved, and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon.</p>
<p>This mixture has frequently been found an efficacious remedy for
a cold, taking a wine-glass of it as often as the cough is
troublesome.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TAMARIND WATER.</b></p>
<p>Put tamarinds into a pitcher or tumbler till it is one-third
full, then fill up with cold water, cover it, and let it infuse for
a quarter of an hour or more.</p>
<p>Currant jelly or cranberry juice mixed with water makes a
pleasant drink for an invalid.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 514]</span><a name='Page_514' id=
"Page_514"></a>
<p><b>SAGO JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Made the same as tapioca. If seasoning is not advisable the sago
may be boiled in milk, instead of water, and eaten plain.</p>
<p>Rice jelly made the same, using only half as much rice as
sago.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ARROWROOT WINE JELLY.</b></p>
<p>One cupful of boiling water, one scant tablespoonful of
arrowroot, mixed with a little cold water, one tablespoonful of
sugar, a pinch of salt, one tablespoonful of brandy, or three
tablespoonfuls of wine. Excellent for a sick person without
fever.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOMINY.</b></p>
<p>Put to soak one pint of hominy in two and one-half pints of
boiling water over night, in a tin vessel with a tight cover; in
the morning add one-half pint of sweet milk and a little salt.
Place on a brisk fire, in a kettle of boiling water, the tin vessel
containing the hominy; let boil one-half hour.</p>
<p>Cracked wheat, oatmeal, mush, are all good food for the
sick.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CHICKEN JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Cook a chicken in enough water to little more than cover it; let
it stew gently until the meat drops from the bones, and the broth
is reduced to about a pint; season it to taste, with a little salt
and pepper. Strain and press, first through a colander, then
through a coarse cloth. Set it over the fire again and cook a few
minutes longer. Turn it into an earthen vegetable dish to harden;
set it on the ice in the refrigerator. Eat cold in slices. Nice
made into sandwiches, with <i>thin</i> slices of bread, lightly
spread with butter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BOILED RICE.</b></p>
<p>Boil half a cupful of rice in just enough water to cover it,
with half a teaspoonful of salt; when the water has boiled nearly
out and the rice begins to look soft and dry, turn over it a cupful
of milk and let it simmer until the rice is done and nearly dry;
take from the fire and beat in a well-beaten egg. Eat it warm with
cream and sugar. Flavor to taste.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 515]</span><a name='Page_515' id=
"Page_515"></a>
<p><b>CUP PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>Take one tablespoonful of flour, one egg, mix with cold milk and
a pinch of salt to a batter. Boil fifteen minutes in a buttered
cup. Eat with sauce, fruit or plain sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TAPIOCA CUP PUDDING.</b></p>
<p>This is very light and delicate for invalids. An even
tablespoonful of tapioca, soaked for two hours in nearly a cup of
new milk; stir into this the yolk of a fresh egg; a little sugar, a
grain of salt, and bake it in a cup for fifteen minutes. A little
jelly may be eaten with it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED APPLES.</b></p>
<p>Get nice fruit, a little tart and juicy, but not sour; clean
them nicely, and bake in a moderate oven&mdash;regulated so as to
have them done in about an hour; when the skin cracks and the pulp
breaks through in every direction they are done and ready to take
out. Serve with white sugar sprinkled over them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOFT TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Toast well, but not too brown, two thin slices of stale bread;
put them on a warm plate, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and pour
upon them some boiling water; quickly cover with another dish of
the same size, and drain off the water. Put a very small bit of
butter on the toast and serve at once while hot.</p>
<br>
<p><b>IRISH MOSS BLANC MANGE.</b></p>
<p>A small handful of moss (to be purchased at any drug store),
wash it very carefully, and put it in one quart of milk on the
fire. Let the milk simmer for about twenty minutes, or until the
moss begins to dissolve. Then remove from the fire and strain
through a fine sieve. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and half a
teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Put away to harden in cups or
molds, and serve with sugar and cream.</p>
<p>A delicate dish for an invalid.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EGG TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Brown a slice of bread nicely over the coals, dip it in hot
water slightly salted, butter it, and lay on the top an egg that
has been <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 516]</span><a name='Page_516'
id="Page_516"></a>broken into boiling water, and cooked until the
white has hardened; season the egg with a bit of butter and a crumb
of salt.</p>
<p>The best way to cook eggs for an invalid is to drop them, or
else pour boiling water over the egg in the shell and let it stand
for a few minutes on the back of the stove.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTER TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Make a nice slice of dry toast, butter it and lay it on a hot
dish. Put six oysters, half a teacupful of their own liquor, and
half a cupful of milk, into a tin cup or basin, and boil one
minute. Season with a little butter, pepper and salt, then pour
over the toast and serve.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MULLED JELLY.</b></p>
<p>Take one tablespoonful of currant or grape jelly, beat with it
the white of one egg and a teaspoonful of sugar; pour on it a
teacupful of boiling water, and break in a slice of dry toast or
two crackers.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUP CUSTARD.</b></p>
<p>Break into a coffeecup an egg, put in two teaspoonfuls of sugar,
beat it up thoroughly, a pinch of salt and a pinch of grated
nutmeg; fill up the cup with good sweet milk, turn it into another
cup, well buttered, and set it in a pan of boiling water, reaching
nearly to the top of the cup. Set in the oven, and when the custard
is set, it is done. Eat cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CLAM BROTH.</b></p>
<p>Select twelve small, hard-shell clams, drain them and chop them
fine; add half a pint of clam juice or hot water, a pinch of
cayenne, and a walnut of butter; simmer thirty minutes, add a gill
of boiled milk, strain, and serve. This is an excellent broth for
weak stomachs.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MILK OR CREAM CODFISH.</b></p>
<p>This dish will often relish when a person is recovering from
sickness, when nothing else would. Pick up a large tablespoonful of
salt codfish very fine, freshen it considerably by placing it over
the fire in a basin, covering it with cold water as it comes to a
boil; turn off the water and freshen again if very salt, then turn
off the water until dry, and pour over half a cupful of milk or
thin cream, add a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 517]</span><a name=
'Page_517' id="Page_517"></a>bit of butter, a sprinkle of pepper,
and a thickening made of one teaspoonful of flour or cornstarch,
wet up with a little milk; when this boils up, turn over a slice of
dipped toast.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRACKER PANADA.</b></p>
<p>Break in pieces three or four hard crackers that are baked quite
brown, and let them boil fifteen minutes in one quart of water;
then remove from the fire, let them stand three or four minutes,
strain off the liquor through a fine wire sieve, and season it with
sugar.</p>
<p>This is a nourishing beverage for infants that are teething, and
with the addition of a little wine and nutmeg, is often prescribed
for invalids recovering from a fever.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAD PANADA.</b></p>
<p>Put three gills of water and one tablespoonful of white sugar on
the fire, and just before it boils add two tablespoonfuls of the
crumbs of stale white bread, stir it well, and let it boil three or
four minutes, then add one glass of white wine, a grated lemon and
a little nutmeg; let it boil up once, then remove it from the fire,
and keep it closely covered until it is wanted for use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SLIPPERY-ELM TEA.</b></p>
<p>Put a teaspoonful of powdered slippery-elm into a tumbler, pour
cold water upon it, and season with lemon and sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOAST WATER, OR CRUST COFFEE.</b></p>
<p>Take stale pieces of crusts of bread, the end pieces of the
loaf, toast them a nice, dark brown, care to be taken that they do
not burn in the least, as that affects the flavor. Put the browned
crusts into a large milk pitcher, and pour enough boiling water
over to cover them; cover the pitcher closely, and let steep until
cold. Strain, and sweeten to taste; put a piece of ice in each
glass.</p>
<p>This is also good, drank warm with cream and sugar, similar to
coffee.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN MILK TOAST.</b></p>
<p>Cut a thin slice from a loaf of stale bread, toast it very
quickly, sprinkle a little salt over it, and pour upon it three
tablespoonfuls of boiling milk or cream. Crackers split and toasted
in this manner, are often very grateful to an invalid.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 518]</span><a name='Page_518' id=
"Page_518"></a>
<p><b>LINSEED TEA.</b></p>
<p>Put one tablespoonful of linseed into a stewpan with half a pint
of cold water; place the stewpan over a moderate fire, and when the
water is quite warm, pour it off, and add to the linseed half a
pint of fresh cold water, then let the whole boil three or four
minutes; season it with lemon and sugar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POWDERS FOR CHILDREN.</b></p>
<p>A very excellent carminative powder for flatulent infants may be
kept in the house, and employed with advantage whenever the child
is in pain or griped, dropping five grains of oil of anise-seed and
two of peppermint on half an ounce of lump sugar, and rubbing it in
a mortar, with a drachm of magnesia, into a fine powder. A small
quantity of this may be given in a little water at any time, and
always with benefit.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FOR CHILDREN TEETHING.</b></p>
<p>Tie a quarter of a pound of wheat flour in a thick cloth and
boil it in one quart of water for three hours; then remove the
cloth and expose the flour to the air or heat until it is hard and
dry; grate from it, when wanted, one tablespoonful, which put into
half a pint of new milk, and stir over the fire until it comes to a
boil, when add a pinch of salt and a tablespoonful of cold water
and serve. This gruel is excellent for children afflicted with
summer complaint.</p>
<p>Or brown a tablespoonful of flour in the oven or on top of the
stove on a baking tin; feed a few pinches at a time to a child and
it will often check a diarrhoea. The tincture of "kino"&mdash;of
which from ten to thirty drops, mixed with a little sugar and water
in a spoon, and given every two or three hours, is very efficacious
and harmless&mdash;can be procured at almost any druggist's.
Tablespoon doses of pure cider vinegar and a pinch of salt, has
cured when all else failed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLACKBERRY CORDIAL.</b></p>
<p>This recipe may be found under the head of COFFEE, TEA,
BEVERAGES. It will be found an excellent medicine for children
teething, and summer diseases.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 519]</span><a name='Page_519' id=
"Page_519"></a>
<p><b>ACID DRINKS.</b></p>
<p>1. Peel thirty large Malaga grapes, and pour half a pint of
boiling water upon them; cover them closely and let them steep
until the water is cold.</p>
<p>2. Pour half a pint of boiling water upon one tablespoonful of
currant jelly, and stir until the jelly is dissolved.</p>
<p>3. Cranberries and barberries may be used in the same way to
make very refreshing acid drinks for persons recovering from
fevers.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRAUGHTS FOR THE FEET.</b></p>
<p>Take a large leaf from the horse-radish plant, and cut out the
hard fibres that run through the leaf; place it on a hot shovel for
a moment to soften it, fold it, and fasten it closely in the hollow
of the foot by a cloth bandage.</p>
<p>Burdock leaves, cabbage leaves, and mullein leaves, are used in
the same manner, to alleviate pain and promote perspiration.</p>
<p>Garlics are also made for draughts by pounding them, placing
them on a hot tin plate for a moment to sweat them, and binding
them closely to the hollow of the foot by a cloth bandage.</p>
<p>Draughts of onions, for infants, are made by roasting onions in
hot ashes, and, when they are quite soft, peeling off the outside,
mashing them, and applying them on a cloth as usual.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POULTICES.</b></p>
<p><i>A Bread and Milk Poultice.</i>&mdash;Put a tablespoonful of
the crumbs of stale bread into a gill of milk, and give the whole
one boil up. Or, take stale bread crumbs, pour over them boiling
water and boil till soft, stirring well; take from the fire and
gradually stir in a little glycerine or sweet oil, so as to render
the poultice pliable when applied.</p>
<p><i>A Hop Poultice.</i>&mdash;Boil one handful of dried hops in
half a pint of water, until the half pint is reduced to a gill,
then stir into it enough Indian meal to thicken it.</p>
<p><i>A Mustard Poultice.</i>&mdash;Into one gill of boiling water
stir one tablespoonful of Indian meal; spread the paste thus made
upon a cloth and spread over the paste one teaspoonful of mustard
flour. If you wish a mild poultice, use a teaspoonful of mustard as
it is prepared for the table, instead of the mustard flour.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 520]</span><a name='Page_520' id=
"Page_520"></a>
<p>Equal parts of ground mustard and flour made into a paste with
warm water, and spread between two pieces of muslin, form the
indispensable mustard plaster.</p>
<p><i>A Ginger Poultice.</i>&mdash;This is made like a mustard
poultice, using ground ginger instead of mustard. A little vinegar
is sometimes added to each of these poultices.</p>
<p><i>A Stramonium Poultice.</i>&mdash;Stir one tablespoonful of
Indian meal into a gill of boiling water and add one tablespoonful
of bruised stramonium seeds.</p>
<p><i>Wormwood and Arnica</i> are sometimes applied in poultices.
Steep the herbs in half a pint of cold water and when all their
virtue is extracted stir in a little bran or rye meal to thicken
the liquid; the herbs must not be removed from the liquid.</p>
<p>This is a useful application for sprains and bruises.</p>
<p><i>Linseed Poultice.</i>&mdash;Take four ounces of powdered
linseed and gradually sprinkle it into a half pint of hot
water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A REMEDY FOR BOILS.</b></p>
<p>An excellent remedy for boils is water of a temperature
agreeable to the feelings of the patient. Apply wet linen to the
part affected and frequently renew or moisten it. It is said to be
the most effectual remedy known. Take inwardly some good blood
purifier.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURE FOR RINGWORMS.</b></p>
<p>Yellow dock, root or leaves, steeped in vinegar, will cure the
worst case of ringworm.</p>

<h2><b>HEALTH-SUGGESTIONS.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>HOW COLDS ARE CAUGHT.</b></p>
<p>A great many cannot see why it is they do not take a cold when
exposed to cold winds and rain. The fact is, and ought to be more
generally understood, that nearly every cold is contracted indoors,
and is not directly due to the cold outside, but to the heat
inside. A man will go to bed at night feeling as well as usual and
get up in the morning with a royal cold. He goes peeking around in
search of cracks and keyholes and tiny drafts. Weather-strips are
procured, and the house made as tight as a fruit can. In a few days
more the whole family have colds.</p>
<p>Let a man go home, tired or exhausted, eat a full supper of
starchy and vegetable food, occupy his mind intently for a while,
go to bed in a warm, close room, and if he doesn't have a cold in
the morning it will be a wonder. A drink of whisky or a glass or
two of beer before supper will facilitate matters very much.</p>
<p>People swallow more colds down their throats than they inhale or
receive from contact with the air, no matter how cold or chilly it
may be. Plain, light suppers are good to go to bed on, and are far
more conducive to refreshing sleep than a glass of beer or a dose
of chloral. In the estimation of a great many this statement is
rank heresy, but in the light of science, common sense and
experience it is gospel truth.</p>
<p>Pure air is strictly essential to maintain perfect health. If a
person is accustomed to sleeping with the windows open there is but
little danger of taking cold winter or summer. Persons that shut up
the windows to keep out the "night air" make a mistake, for at
night the only air we breathe is "night air," and we need good air
while asleep as much or even more than at any other time of day.
Ventilation can be accomplished by simply opening the window an
inch at the bottom and also at the top, thus letting the pure air
in, the bad air going <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 522]</span><a name=
'Page_522' id="Page_522"></a>outward at the top. Close, foul air
poisons the blood, brings on disease which often results in death;
this poisoning of the blood is only prevented by pure air, which
enters the lungs, becomes charged with <i>waste</i> particles, then
thrown out, and which are poisoning if taken back again. It is
estimated that a grown person corrupts <i>one gallon of pure air
every minute</i>, or twenty-five barrels full in a single night, in
breathing alone.</p>
<p>Clothes that have been worn through the day should be changed
for fresh or dry ones to sleep in. Three pints of moisture, filled
with the waste of the body, are given off every twenty-four hours,
and this is mostly absorbed by the clothing. Sunlight and exposure
to the air purifies the clothing of the poisons which nature is
trying to dispose of, and which would otherwise be brought again
into contact with the body.</p>
<p>Colds are often taken by extreme cold and heat, and a sudden
exposure to cold by passing from a heated room to the cold outside
air. Old and weak persons, especially, should avoid such extreme
change. In passing from warm crowded rooms to the cold air, the
mouth should be kept closed, and all the breathing done through the
nostrils only, that the cold air may be warmed before it reaches
the lungs, or else the sudden change will drive the blood from the
surface of the internal organs, often producing congestions.</p>
<p>Dr. B. I. Kendall writes that "<i>the temperature of the
body</i> should be evenly and properly maintained to secure perfect
health; and to accomplish this purpose requires great care and
caution at times. The human body is, so to speak, the most delicate
and intricate piece of machinery that could possibly be conceived
of, and to keep this in perfect order requires constant care. It is
a fixed law of nature that every violation thereof shall be
punished; and so we find that he who neglects to care for his body
by protecting it from sudden changes of weather, or draughts of
cold air upon unprotected parts of the body, suffers the penalty by
sickness, which may vary according to the exposure and the habits
of the person, which affect the result materially; for what would
be an easy day's work for a man who is accustomed to hard labor,
would be sufficient to excite the circulation to such an extent in
a person unaccustomed to work, that only slight exposure might
cause the death of the latter when over-heated in this way; while
the same exercise and exposure to the man accustomed to hard labor
might not <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 523]</span><a name='Page_523'
id="Page_523"></a>affect him. So, we say, be careful of your
bodies, for it is a duty you owe to yourselves, your friends, and
particularly to Him who created you. When your body is over-heated
and you are perspiring, be very careful about sitting down to 'cool
off,' as the custom of some is, by removing a part of the clothing
and sitting in a cool place, and perhaps where there is a draught
of air passing over your body. The proper way to 'cool off' when
over-heated is to put on more clothing, especially if you are in a
cool place; but never remove a part of the clothing you have
already on. If possible get near a fire where there is no wind
blowing, and <i>dry off</i> gradually, instead of cooling off
suddenly, which is always dangerous."</p>
<p>Many colds are taken from the feet being damp or wet. To keep
these extremities warm and dry is a great preventative against the
almost endless list of disorders which come from a "slight cold."
Many imagine if their feet are not thoroughly wet, there will be no
harm arising from mere dampness, not knowing that the least
dampness is absorbed into the sole, and is attracted nearer the
foot itself by its heat, and thus perspiration is dangerously
checked.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WATER.</b></p>
<p>All beings need drink as much as they need food, and it is just
as necessary to health as pure air; therefore the water should be
boiled or filtered before being drank. Rain-water filtered is
probably the best attainable. Boiling the water destroys the
vegetable and animal matter, and leaves the mineral matter
deposited on the bottom of the vessel containing it; therefore it
leaves it clear from poisonous substances.</p>
<br>
<p><b>REGULATION IN DIET.</b></p>
<p>The food we eat is a very important item, and one which it would
be difficult to arrange any rule for which would apply to all
persons under different circumstances. In health, it is safer to
eat by instinct rather than to follow any definite rules. While
there are many who have a scanty living, with a small variety of
food, there is a large number who have an abundance and a large
variety. The former class, in many cases, live miserable lives,
either to hoard up for miserly purposes the money which might make
them happy, or in some cases through poverty; while the latter
class, as a rule, have better health and have much more enjoyment
in this life, unless it be some <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
524]</span><a name='Page_524' id="Page_524"></a>who are gluttonous,
and make themselves miserable by abusing the blessings they should
enjoy. Avoid extremes in living too free or scanty; have a good
nourishing diet and a sufficient quantity, and it should always be
properly cooked; for if the cooking is poorly done, it affects not
only the nutritious qualities, but is not so easily digested, thus
making food, which is originally the best kind, of very little
value to us, and with very poor cooking it is sometimes a positive
injury.</p>
<p>It is very important that the food be taken with regularity at
the accustomed time. Be careful not to take too much drink during
any meal, but, if thirsty, drink water before meal time so that you
will not care for it until some time after eating, as it is a bad
plan to drink much either during or for a little time after the
meal is taken. It is a very bad plan to hurry in eating, because by
so doing the food is not properly masticated; it is better to be a
long time in eating and chew the food well.</p>

<br>
<p><b>HOW TO USE HOT WATER.</b></p>
<p>One of the simplest and most effectual means of relieving pain
is by the use of hot water, externally and internally, the
temperature varying according to the feelings of the patient. For
bruises, sprains, and similar accidental hurts, it should be
applied immediately, as hot as can be borne, by means of a cloth
dipped in the water and laid on the wounded part, or by immersion,
if convenient, and the treatment kept up until relief is obtained.
If applied at once, the use of hot water will generally prevent,
nearly, if not entirely, the bruised flesh from turning black. For
pains resulting from indigestion, and known as wind colic, etc., a
cupful of hot water, taken in sips, will often relieve at once.
When that is insufficient, a flannel folded in several thicknesses,
large enough to fully cover the painful place should be wrung out
of hot water and laid over the seat of the pain. It should be as
hot as the skin can bear without injury, and be renewed every ten
minutes or oftener, if it feels cool, until the pain is gone. The
remedy is simple, efficient, harmless, and within the reach of
every one; and should be more generally used than it is. If used
along with common sense, it might save many a doctor's bill, and
many a course of drug treatment as well.</p>

<p><b>GROWING PAINS CURED.</b></p>
<p>Following in our mother's footsteps, we have been routed night
after night from our warm quarters, in the dead of winter, to
kindle fires and fill frosty kettles from water-pails thickly
crusted with ice, that we might get the writhing pedal extremities
of our little heir into a tub of water as quickly as possible. But
lately we have learned that all this work and exposure is needless.
We simply wring a towel from salted water&mdash;a bowl of it
standing in our sleeping room, ready for such an
emergency&mdash;wrap the limb in it from the ankle to knee, without
taking the child from his bed, and then swathe with dry flannels,
thick and warm, tucking the blankets about him a little closer, and
relief is sure.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Good Housekeeping.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO KEEP WELL.</b></p>
<p>Don't sleep in a draught.</p>
<p>Don't go to bed with cold feet.</p>
<p>Don't stand over hot-air registers.</p>
<p>Don't eat what you do not need, just to save it.</p>
<p>Don't try to get cool too quickly after exercising.</p>
<p>Don't sleep in a room without ventilation of some kind.</p>
<p>Don't stuff a cold lest you should be next obliged to starve a
fever.</p>
<p>Don't sit in a damp or chilly room without a fire.</p>
<p>Don't try to get along without flannel underclothing in
winter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DIPHTHERIA.</b></p>
<p>A gargle of sulphur and water has been used with much success in
cases of diphtheria. Let the patient swallow a little of the
mixture. Or, when you discover that your throat is a little sore,
bind a strip of flannel around the throat, wet in camphor, and
gargle salt and vinegar occasionally.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COLDS AND HOARSENESS.</b></p>
<p>Borax has proved a most effective remedy in certain forms of
colds. In sudden hoarseness or loss of voice in public speakers or
singers, from colds, relief for an hour or so may be obtained by
slowly dissolving, and partially swallowing, a lump of borax the
size of a garden pea, or about three or four grains held in the
mouth for ten or fifteen minutes before speaking or singing. This
produces a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 526]</span><a name='Page_526'
id="Page_526"></a>profuse secretion of saliva or "watering" of the
mouth and throat, just as wetting brings back the missing notes to
a flute when it is too dry.</p>
<p>A flannel dipped in boiling water and sprinkled with turpentine,
laid on chest as quickly as possible, will relieve the most severe
cold or hoarseness.</p>
<p>Another simple, pleasant remedy is furnished by beating up the
white of one egg, adding to it the juice of one lemon, and
sweetening with white sugar to taste. Take a teaspoonful from time
to time. It has been known to effectually cure the ailment.</p>
<p>Or bake a lemon or sour orange twenty minutes in a moderate
oven. When done, open at one end and take out the inside. Sweeten
with sugar or molasses. This is an excellent remedy for
hoarseness.</p>
<p>An old time and good way to relieve a cold is to go to bed and
stay there, <i>drinking nothing</i>, not even water, for
twenty-four hours, and eating as little as possible. Or go to bed,
put your feet in hot mustard and water, put a bran or oatmeal
poultice on the chest, take ten grains of Dover's powder, and an
hour afterwards a pint of hot gruel; in the morning, rub the body
all over with a coarse towel, and take a dose of aperient
medicine.</p>
<p>Violet, pennyroyal or boneset tea, is excellent to promote
perspiration in case of sudden chill. Care should be taken next day
not to get chilled by exposure to fresh out-door air.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOLASSES POSSET.</b></p>
<p>This old-fashioned remedy for a cold is as effectual now as it
was in old times. Put into a saucepan a pint of the best West India
molasses, a teaspoonful of powdered white ginger and a quarter of a
pound of fresh butter. Set it over the fire and simmer it slowly
for half an hour, stirring it frequently. Do not let it come to a
boil. Then stir in the juice of two lemons, or two tablespoonfuls
of vinegar; cover the pan and let it stand by the fire five minutes
longer. This is good for a cold. Some of it may be taken warm at
once, and the remainder kept at hand for occasional use.</p>
<p>It is the preparation absurdly called by the common people
<i>stewed quaker</i>.</p>
<p>Half a pint of strained honey mixed cold with the juice of a
lemon and a tablespoonful of sweet oil, is another remedy for a
cold; a teaspoonful or two to be taken whenever the cough is
troublesome.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 527]</span><a name='Page_527' id=
"Page_527"></a>
<p><b>COUGH SYRUP.</b></p>
<p>Syrup of squills four ounces, syrup of tolu four ounces,
tincture of bloodroot one and one-half ounces, camphorated tincture
of opium four ounces. Mix. Dose for an adult, one teaspoonful
repeated every two to four hours, or as often as necessary.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LEANNESS.</b></p>
<p>Is caused generally by lack of power in the digestive organs to
digest and assimilate the fat-producing elements of food. First
restore digestion, take plenty of sleep, drink all the water the
stomach will bear in the morning on rising, take moderate exercise
in the open air, eat oatmeal, cracked wheat, graham mush, baked
sweet apples, roasted and broiled beef, cultivate jolly people, and
bathe daily.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FOR TOOTHACHE.</b></p>
<p>The worst toothache, or neuralgia, coming from the teeth may be
speedily and delightfully ended by the application of a bit of
clean cotton saturated in a solution of ammonia to the defective
tooth. Sometimes the late sufferer is prompted to momentary
laughter by the application, but the pain will disappear.</p>
<p>Alum reduced to a powder, a teaspoonful of the powder and an
equal quantity of fine salt well mixed, applied to the gums by
dipping your moistened finger in the mixed powder; put some also in
the tooth, and keep rubbing the gums with it; it scarcely ever
fails to cure.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CURE A STING OF A BEE OR WASP.</b></p>
<p>Bind on common baking soda, dampened with water. Or mix common
earth with water to about the consistency of mud.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CURE EARACHE.</b></p>
<p>Take a bit of cotton batting, put on it a pinch of black pepper,
gather it up and tie it, dip it in sweet oil, and insert it in the
ear; put a flannel bandage over the head to keep it warm; it often
gives immediate relief.</p>
<p>Tobacco smoke, puffed into the ear, has often been
effectual.</p>
<p>Another remedy: Take equal parts of tincture of opium and
glycerine. Mix, and from a warm teaspoon drop two or three drops
into <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 528]</span><a name='Page_528' id=
"Page_528"></a>the ear, stop the ear tight with cotton, and repeat
every hour or two. If matter should form in the ear, make a suds
with castile soap and warm water, about 100&deg; F., or a little
more than milk warm, and have some person inject it into the ear
while you hold that side of your head the lowest. If it does not
heal in due time, inject a little carbolic acid and water in the
proportion of one drachm of the acid to one pint of warm water each
time after using the suds.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CROUP.</b></p>
<p>Croup, it is said, can be cured in one minute, and the remedy is
simply alum and sugar. Take a knife or grater and shave off in
small particles about a teaspoonful of alum; then mix it with twice
its amount of sugar, to make it palatable, and administer it as
quickly as possible. Almost instantaneous relief will follow.
Turpentine is said to be an excellent remedy for croup. Saturate a
piece of flannel and apply it to the chest and throat, and take
inwardly three or four drops on a lump of sugar.</p>
<p><i>Another remedy.</i>&mdash;Give a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha
wine every few minutes, until free vomiting is excited.</p>
<p>Another recipe said to be most reliable: Take two ounces of the
wine of ipecac, hive syrup four ounces, tincture of bloodroot two
ounces. Mix it well.</p>
<p>Dose for a child one year old, five to ten drops; two years,
eight to twelve drops; three years, twelve to fifteen drops; four
years, fifteen to twenty drops; five years, twenty to twenty-five
drops, and older children in proportion to age. Repeat as often as
shall be necessary to procure relief. If it is thought best to
produce vomiting, repeat the dose every ten or fifteen minutes for
a few doses.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BURNS AND SCALDS.</b></p>
<p>A piece of cotton wadding, spread with butter or sweet oil, and
bound on the burn instantly, will draw out the pain without leaving
a scar; also a handful of flour, bound on instantly, will prevent
blistering. The object is to entirely exclude the air from the part
affected. Some use common baking-soda, dry or wet, often giving
instant relief, withdrawing the heat and pain. Another valuable
remedy is to beat the yellow of an egg into linseed oil, and apply
it with a feather on the injured part frequently. It will afford
ready relief and heals with <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
529]</span><a name='Page_529' id="Page_529"></a>great rapidity.
Some recommend the white part of the egg, which is very cooling and
soothing, and soon allays the smarting pain. It is the exposure of
the part coming in contact with the air that gives the extreme
discomfort experienced from ordinary afflictions of this kind, and
anything which excludes air and prevents inflammation is the thing
to be at once applied.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD.</b></p>
<p>For a slight cut there is nothing better to control the
hemorrhage than common unglazed brown wrapping paper, such as is
used by marketmen and grocers; a piece to be bound over the wound.
A handful of flour bound on the cut. Cobwebs and brown sugar,
pressed on like lint. When the blood ceases to flow, apply arnica
or laudanum.</p>
<p>When an artery is cut the red blood spurts out at each
pulsation. Press the thumb firmly over the artery near the wound,
and on the side toward the heart. Press hard enough to stop the
bleeding, and wait till a physician comes. The wounded person is
often able to do this himself, if he has the requisite
knowledge.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRAVEL.</b></p>
<p>Into a pint of water put two ounces of bicarbonate of soda. Take
two tablespoonfuls in the early forenoon, and the same toward
night; also drink freely of water through the day. Inflammation of
the kidneys has been successfully treated with large doses of
lime-water.</p>
<p>Persons troubled with kidney difficulty should abstain from
sugar and the things that are converted into sugar in digestion,
such as starchy food and sweet vegetables.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SORE THROAT.</b></p>
<p>Everybody has a cure for this trouble, but simple remedies
appear to be most effectual. Salt and water is used by many as a
gargle, but a little alum and honey dissolved in sage tea is
better. An application of cloths wrung out of hot water and applied
to the neck, changing as often as they begin to cool, has the most
potency for removing inflammation of anything we ever tried. It
should be kept up for a number of hours; during the evening is
usually the most convenient time for applying this remedy.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 530]</span><a name='Page_530' id=
"Page_530"></a>
<p>Cut slices of salt pork or fat bacon, simmer a few minutes in
hot vinegar, and apply to throat as hot as possible. When this is
taken off as the throat is relieved, put around a bandage of soft
flannel. A gargle of equal parts of borax and alum, dissolved in
water, is also excellent. To be used frequently.</p>
<p>Camphorated oil is an excellent lotion for sore throat, sore
chest, aching limbs, etc. For a gargle for sore throat, put a pinch
of chlorate of potash in a glass of water. Gargle the throat with
it twice a day, or oftener, if necessary.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHOOPING COUGH.</b></p>
<p>Two level tablespoonfuls of powdered alum, two-thirds of a
cupful of brown sugar, dissolved in two quarts of water; bottle and
put in a dark closet where it is cool.</p>
<p>For a child one year old, a teaspoonful three times a day on an
empty stomach. For a child two years old, two teaspoonfuls for a
dose. For a child five years old, a tablespoonful. The state of the
bowels must be attended to, and the doses repeated accordingly. No
other medicine to be taken, except an emetic, at first, if
desirable. Except in the case of an infant, a milk diet is to be
avoided.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DIARRHOEA.</b></p>
<p>Take tincture of Jamaica ginger one ounce, tincture of rhubarb
one ounce, tincture of opium half ounce, tincture of cardamom one
and one-half ounces, tincture of kino one ounce. Mix. Dose for an
adult, half to one teaspoonful, repeated every two to four hours;
and for children one year old, five drops; two years old, five to
ten drops; three years old, ten to twelve drops, and older children
in proportion to age.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FOR CONSTIPATION.</b></p>
<p>One or two figs eaten fasting is sufficient for some, and they
are especially good in the case of children, as there is no trouble
in getting them to take them. A spoonful of wheaten bran in a glass
of water is a simple remedy, and quite effective, taken half an
hour before breakfast; fruit eaten raw; partake largely of laxative
food; exercise in the open air; drink freely of cold water during
the day, etc. It is impossible to give many of the numerous
treatments in so short a space, suffice it to say that the general
character of our diet and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg
531]</span><a name='Page_531' id="Page_531"></a> experience is such
as to assure us that at least one-quarter of the food that we
swallow is intended by nature to be evacuated from the system; and
if it is not, it is again absorbed into the system, poisoning the
blood and producing much suffering and permanent disease. The
evacuation of the bowels <i>daily</i>, and above all,
<i>regularity</i>, is therefore all important to aid this form of
disorder.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RELIEF FROM ASTHMA.</b></p>
<p>Sufferers from asthma should get a muskrat skin and wear it over
their lungs with the fur side next to the body. It will bring
certain relief.</p>
<p>Or soak blotting paper in saltpetre water, then dry, burning at
night in the patient's bedroom.</p>
<p>Another excellent recipe: Take powdered liquorice root, powdered
elecampane root, powdered anise-seed, each one drachm, powdered
ipecac ten grains, powdered lobelia ten grains; add sufficient
amount of tar to form into pills of ordinary size. Take three or
four pills on going to bed. An excellent remedy for asthma or
shortness of breath.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RECIPES FOR FELONS.</b></p>
<p>Take common rock salt, as used for salting down pork or beef,
dry in an oven, then pound it fine and mix with spirits of
turpentine in equal parts; put it in a rag and wrap it around the
parts affected; as it gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four
hours you are cured. The felon will be dead.</p>
<p>Or purchase the herb of stramonium at the druggist's; steep it
and bind it on the felon; as soon as cold, put on new, warm herbs.
It will soon kill it, in a few hours at least.</p>
<p>Or saturate a bit or grated wild turnip, the size of a bean,
with spirits of turpentine, and apply it to the affected part. It
relieves the pain at once; in twelve hours there will be a hole to
the bone, and the felon destroyed; then apply healing salve, and
the finger is well.</p>
<p><i>Another Way to Cure a Felon:</i> Fill a tumbler with equal
parts of fine salt and ice; mix well. Sink the finger in the
centre, allow it to remain until it is nearly frozen and numb; then
withdraw it, and when sensation is restored, renew the operation
four or five times, when it will be found the disease is destroyed.
This must be done before pus is formed.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 532]</span><a name='Page_532' id=
"Page_532"></a>
<p>A simple remedy for felons, relieving pain at once, no
poulticing, no cutting, no "holes to the bone," no necessity for
healing salve, but simple oil of cedar applied a few times at the
commencement of the felon, and the work is done.</p>
<br>
<p><b>REMEDY FOR LOCKJAW.</b></p>
<p>If any person is threatened or taken with lockjaw from injuries
of the arms, legs or feet, do not wait for a doctor, but put the
part injured in the following preparation: Put hot wood-ashes into
water as warm as can be borne; if the injured part cannot be put
into water, then wet thick folded cloths in the water and apply
them to the part as soon as possible, at the same time bathe the
backbone from the neck down with some laxative stimulant&mdash;say
cayenne pepper and water, or mustard and water (good vinegar is
better than water); it should be as hot as the patient can bare it.
Don't hesitate; go to work and do it, and don't stop until the jaws
will come open. No person need die of lockjaw if these directions
are followed.</p>
<p><i>Cure for Lockjaw, Said to be Positive.</i>&mdash;Let anyone
who has an attack of lockjaw take a small quantity of spirits of
turpentine, warm it, and pour it in the wound&mdash;no matter where
the wound is or what its nature is&mdash;and relief will follow in
less than one minute. Turpentine is also a sovereign remedy for
croup. Saturate a piece of flannel with it, and place the flannel
on the throat and chest&mdash;- and in very severe cases, three to
five drops on a lump of sugar may be taken internally.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BLEEDING AT THE NOSE.</b></p>
<p>Roll up a piece of paper and press it under the upper lip. In
obstinate cases, blow a little gum arabic up the nostril through a
quill, which will immediately stop the discharge; powdered alum,
dissolved in water, is also good. Pressure by the finger over the
small artery near the ala (wing) of the nose on the side where the
blood is flowing, is said to arrest the hemorrhage immediately.
Sometimes by wringing a cloth out of very hot water and laying it
on the back of the neck, gives relief. Napkins wrung out of cold
water must be laid across the forehead and nose, the hands dipped
in cold water, and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 533]</span><a name='Page_533' id=

<p><b>TO TAKE CINDERS FROM THE EYE.</b></p>
<p>In most cases a simple and effective cure may be found in one or
two grains of flax-seed, which can be placed in the eye without
pain or injury. As they dissolve, a glutinous substance is formed,
which envelops any foreign body that may be under the lid, and the
whole is easily washed out. A dozen of these seeds should
constitute a part of every traveler's outfit.</p>
<p>Another remedy for removing objects from the eye: Take a
horse-hair and double it, leaving a loop. If the object can be
seen, lay the loop over it, close the eye, and the mote will come
out as the hair is withdrawn. If the irritating object cannot be
seen, raise the lid of the eye as high as possible and place the
loop as far as you can, close the eye and roll the ball around a
few times, draw out the hair, and the substance which caused the
pain will be sure to come with it. This method is practiced by
axemakers and other workers in steel.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Montreal Star.</i></div>
<br>
<p><b>EYE-WASHES.</b></p>
<p>The best eye-wash for granulated lids and inflammation of the
eyes is composed of camphor, borax and morphine, in the following
proportions: To a large wine-glass of camphor water&mdash;not
spirits&mdash;add two grains of morphine and six grains of borax.
Pour a few drops into the palm of the hand, and hold the eye in it,
opening the lid as much as possible. Do this three or four times in
twenty-four hours, and you will receive great relief from pain and
smarting soreness. This recipe was received from a celebrated
oculist, and has never failed to relieve the most inflamed
eyes.</p>
<p>Another remedy said to be reliable: A lump of alum as large as a
cranberry boiled in a teacupful of sweet milk, and the curd used as
a poultice, is excellent for inflammation of the eyes.</p>
<p>Another wash: A cent's worth of pure, refined white copperas
dissolved in a pint of water, is also a good lotion; but label it
<i>poison</i>, as it should never go near the mouth. Bathe the eyes
with the mixture, either with the hands or a small piece of linen
cloth, allowing some of the liquid to get under the lids.</p>
<p>Here is another from an eminent oculist: Take half an ounce of
rock salt and one ounce of dry sulphate of zinc; simmer in a clean,
covered porcelain vessel with three pints of water until all are
dissolved; strain through thick muslin; add one ounce of
rose-water; <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 534]</span><a name='Page_534'
id="Page_534"></a>bottle and cork it tight. To use it, mix one
teaspoonful of rain-water with one of the eye-water, and bathe the
eyes frequently. If it smarts too much, add more water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SUNSTROKE.</b></p>
<p>Wrap a wet cloth bandage over the head; wet another cloth,
folded small, square, cover it thickly with salt, and bind it on
the back of the neck; apply dry salt behind the ears. Put mustard
plasters to the calves of the legs and soles of the feet. This is
an effectual remedy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO REMOVE WARTS.</b></p>
<p>Wash with water saturated with common washing-soda, and let it
dry without wiping; repeat frequently until they disappear. Or pass
a pin through the wart and hold one end of it over the flame of a
candle or lamp until the wart fires by the heat, and it will
disappear.</p>
<p>Another treatment of warts is to pare the hard and dry skin from
their tops, and then touch them with the smallest drop of strong
acetic acid, taking care that the acid does not run off the wart
upon the neighboring skin; for if it does it will occasion
inflammation and much pain. If this is continued once or twice
daily, with regularity, paring the surface of the wart occasionally
when it gets hard and dry, the wart will soon be effectually
cured.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SWAIM'S VERMIFUGE.</b></p>
<p>Worm seed, two ounces; valerian, rhubarb, pink root, white
agaric, senna, of each one ounce and a half. Boil in sufficient
water to yield three quarts of decoction. Now add to it ten drops
of the oil of tansy and forty-five drops of the oil of cloves,
dissolved in a quart of rectified spirit. Dose: one tablespoonful
at night.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FAINTING. (Syncope.)</b></p>
<p>Immediately place the person fainting in a lying position, with
head lower than body. In this way consciousness returns
immediately, while in the erect position it often ends in
death.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 535]</span><a name='Page_535' id=

<p><b>FOR SEVERE SPRAINS.</b></p>
<p>The white of an egg, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a
tablespoonful of spirits of turpentine. Mix in a bottle, shake
thoroughly, and bathe the sprain as soon as possible after the
accident. This was published in <i>Life Secrets</i>, but it is
republished by request on account of its great value. It should be
remembered by everyone.</p>
<p>An invaluable remedy for a sprain or bruise is wormwood boiled
in vinegar and applied hot, with enough cloths wrapped around it to
keep the sprain moist.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CAMPHORATED OIL.</b></p>
<p>Best oil of Lucca, gum camphor. Pound some gum camphor and fill
a wide-necked pint bottle one-third full; fill up with olive oil
and set away until the camphor is absorbed. Excellent lotion for
sore chest, sore throat, aching limbs, etc.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LINIMENT FOR CHILBLAINS.</b></p>
<p>Spirits of turpentine, three drachms; camphorated oil, nine
drachms.</p>
<p>Mix for a liniment. For an adult four drachms of the former and
eight of the latter may be used. If the child be young, or if the
skin be tender, the camphorated oil may be used without the
turpentine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>"THE SUN'S" CHOLERA MIXTURE.</b></p>
<p>More than forty years ago, when it was found that prevention for
the Asiatic cholera was easier than cure, the learned doctors of
both hemispheres drew up a prescription, which was published (for
working people) in <i>The New York Sun</i>, and took the name of
"The Sun Cholera Mixture." It is found to be the best remedy for
looseness of the bowels ever yet devised. It is to be commended for
several reasons. It is not to be mixed with liquor, and therefore
will not be used as an alcoholic beverage. Its ingredients are well
known among all the common people, and it will have no prejudice to
combat; each of the materials is in equal proportions to the
others, and it may therefore be compounded without professional
skill; and as the dose is so very small, it may be carried in a
tiny phial in the waistcoat pocket, and be always at hand. It
is:&mdash;</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 536]</span><a name='Page_536' id=
"Page_536"></a>
<p>Take equal parts of tincture of cayenne, tincture of opium,
tincture of rhubarb, essence of peppermint and spirits of camphor.
Mix well. Dose fifteen to thirty drops in a wine-glass of water,
according to age and violence of the attack. Repeat every fifteen
or twenty minutes until relief is obtained. No one who takes it in
time will ever have the cholera. Even when no cholera is
anticipated, it is a valuable remedy for ordinary summer
complaints, and should always be kept in readiness.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COMP. CATHARTIC ELIXIR.</b></p>
<p>The only pleasant and reliable cathartic in liquid form that can
be prescribed.</p>
<p>Each fluid ounce contains: sulp. magnesia one drachm, senna two
drachms, scammony six grains, liquorice one drachm, ginger three
grains, coriander, five grains, with flavoring ingredients.</p>
<p><i>Dose.</i>&mdash;Child five years old, one or two
teaspoonfuls; adult, one or two tablespoonfuls.</p>
<p>This preparation is being used extensively throughout the
country. It was originated with the design of furnishing a liquid
cathartic remedy that could be prescribed in a palatable form. It
will be taken by children with a relish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRANDMOTHER'S COUGH SYRUP.</b></p>
<p>Take half a pound of dry hoarhound herbs, one pod of red pepper,
four tablespoonfuls of ginger, boil all in three quarts of water,
then strain, and add one teaspoonful of good, fresh tar and a pound
of sugar. Boil slowly and stir often, until it is reduced to one
quart of syrup. When cool, bottle for use. Take one or two
teaspoonfuls four or six times a day.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRANDMOTHER'S UNIVERSAL LINIMENT.</b></p>
<p>One pint of alcohol and as much camphor gum as can be dissolved
in it, half an ounce of the oil of cedar, one-half ounce of the oil
of sassafras, aqua ammonia half an ounce, and the same amount of
the tincture of morphine. Shake well together and apply by the
fire; the liniment must not be heated, or come in contact with the
fire, but the rubbing to be done by the warmth of the fire.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 537]</span><a name='Page_537' id=
"Page_537"></a>
<p>These recipes of Grandmother's are all old, tried medicines, and
are more effectual than most of those that are advertised, as they
have been thoroughly tried, and proved reliable.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY SPRING BITTERS.</b></p>
<p>Mandrake root one ounce, dandelion root one ounce, burdock root
one ounce, yellow dock root one ounce, prickly ash berries two
ounces, marsh mallow one ounce, turkey rhubarb half an ounce,
gentian one ounce, English camomile flowers one ounce, red clover
tops two ounces.</p>
<p>Wash the herbs and roots; put them into an earthen vessel, pour
over two quarts of water that has been boiled and cooled; let it
stand over night and soak; in the morning set it on the back of the
stove, and steep it five hours; it must not boil, but be nearly
ready to boil. Strain it through a cloth, and add half a pint of
good gin. Keep it in a cool place. Half a wine-glass taken as a
dose twice a day.</p>
<p>This is better than all the patent blood medicines that are in
the market&mdash;a superior blood purifier, and will cure almost
any malignant sore, by taking according to direction, and washing
the sore with a strong tea of red raspberry leaves steeped, first
washing the sore with castile soap, then drying with a soft cloth,
and washing it with the strong tea of red raspberry leaves.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GRANDMOTHER'S EYE-WASH.</b></p>
<p>Take three fresh eggs and break them into one quart of clear,
cold rain-water; stir until thoroughly mixed; bring to a boil on a
slow fire, stirring often; then add half an ounce of sulphate of
zinc (white vitrol); continue the boiling for two minutes, then set
it off the fire. Take the curd that settles at the bottom of this
and apply to the eye at night with a bandage. It will speedily draw
out all fever and soreness. Strain the liquid through a cloth and
use for bathing the eyes occasionally. This is the best eye-water
ever made for man or beast. I have used it for twenty years without
knowing it to fail.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HUNTER'S PILLS.</b></p>
<p>These pills can be manufactured at home and are <i>truly
reliable</i>, having been sold and used for more than fifty years
in Europe. The ingredients may be procured at almost any
druggist's. The articles should be all in the powder. Saffron one
grain, rue one grain, Scot <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
538]</span><a name='Page_538' id="Page_538"></a>aloes two grains,
savin one grain, cayenne pepper one grain. Mix all into a very
thick mass by adding sufficient syrup. Rub some fine starch on the
surface of a platter or large dinner-plate, then with your
forefinger and thumb nip off a small piece of the mass the size of
a pill and roll it in pill form, first dipping your fingers in the
starch. Place them as fast as made on the platter, set where they
will dry slowly. Put them into a dry bottle or paper box. Dose, one
every night and morning as long as occasion requires.</p>
<p>This recipe is worth <i>ten times</i> the price of this book to
any female requiring the <i>need</i> of these regulating pills.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HINTS IN REGARD TO HEALTH.</b></p>
<p>It is plainly seen by an inquiring mind that, aside from the
selection and preparation of food, there are many little things
constantly arising in the experience of everyday life which, in
their combined effect, are powerful agents in the formation (or
prevention) of perfect health. A careful observance of these little
occurences, an inquiry into the philosophy attending them, lies
within the province, and indeed should be considered among the
highest duties, of every housekeeper.</p>
<p>That one should be cautious about entering a sick room in a
state of perspiration, as the moment you become cool your pores
absorb. Do not approach contagious diseases with an empty stomach,
nor sit between the sick and the fire, because the heat attracts
the vapor.</p>
<p>That the flavor of cod-liver oil may be changed to the
delightful one of fresh oyster, if the patient will drink a large
glass of water poured from a vessel in which nails have been
allowed to rust.</p>
<p>That a bag of hot sand relieves neuralgia.</p>
<p>That warm borax water will remove dandruff.</p>
<p>That salt should be eaten with nuts to aid digestion.</p>
<p>That it rests you, in sewing, to change your position
frequently.</p>
<p>That a little soda water will relieve sick headache caused by
indigestion.</p>
<p>That a cupful of strong coffee will remove the odor of onions
from the breath.</p>
<p>That well-ventilated bedrooms will prevent morning headaches and
lassitude.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 539]</span><a name='Page_539' id=
"Page_539"></a>
<p>A cupful of hot water drank before meals will relieve nausea and
dyspepsia.</p>
<p>That a fever patient can be made cool and comfortable by
frequent sponging off with soda water.</p>
<p>That consumptive night-sweats may be arrested by sponging the
body nightly in salt water.</p>
<p>That one in a faint should be laid flat on his back, then loosen
his clothes and let him alone.</p>
<p>The best time to bathe is just before going to bed, as any
danger of taking cold is thus avoided; and the complexion is
improved by keeping warm for several hours after leaving the
bath.</p>
<p>To beat the whites of eggs quickly add a pinch of salt. Salt
cools, and cold eggs froth rapidly.</p>
<p>Hot, dry flannels, applied as hot as possible, for
neuralgia.</p>
<p>Sprains and bruises call for an application of the tincture of
arnica.</p>
<p>If an artery is severed, tie a small cord or handkerchief above
it.</p>
<p>For bilious colic, soda and ginger in hot water. It may be taken
freely.</p>
<p>Tickling in the throat is best relieved by a gargling of salt
and water.</p>
<p>Pains in the side are most promptly relieved by the application
of mustard.</p>
<p>For cold in the head nothing is better than powdered borax,
sniffed up the nostrils.</p>
<p>A drink of hot, strong lemonade before going to bed will often
break up a cold and cure a sore throat.</p>
<p>Nervous spasms are usually relieved by a little salt taken into
the mouth and allowed to dissolve.</p>
<p>Whooping cough paroxysms are relieved by breathing the fumes of
turpentine and carbolic acid.</p>
<p>Broken limbs should be placed in natural positions, and the
patient kept quiet until the surgeon arrives.</p>
<p>Hemorrhages of the lungs or stomach are promptly checked by
small doses of salt. The patient should be kept as quiet as
possible.</p>
<p>Sleeplessness, caused by too much blood in the head may be
overcome by applying a cloth wet with cold water to the back of the
neck.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 540]</span><a name='Page_540' id=
"Page_540"></a>
<p>Wind colic is promptly relieved by peppermint essence taken in a
little warm water. For small children it may be sweetened.
Paregoric is also good.</p>
<p>For stomach cramps, ginger ale or a teaspoonful of the tincture
of ginger in a half glass of water in which a half teaspoonful of
soda has been dissolved.</p>
<p>Sickness of the stomach is most promptly relieved by drinking a
teacupful of hot soda and water. If it brings the offending matter
up, all the better.</p>
<p>A teaspoonful of ground mustard in a cupful of warm water is a
prompt and reliable emetic, and should be resorted to in cases of
poisoning or cramps in the stomach from over-eating.</p>
<p>Avoid purgatives or strong physic, as they not only do no good,
but are positively hurtful. Pills may relieve for the time, but
they seldom cure.</p>
<p>Powdered resin is the best thing to stop bleeding from cuts.
After the powder is sprinkled on, wrap the wound with soft cotton
cloth. As soon as the wound begins to feel feverish, keep the cloth
wet with cold water.</p>
<p>Eggs are considered one of the best remedies for dysentery.
Beaten up slightly, with or without sugar, and swallowed, they tend
by their emollient qualities to lessen the inflammation of the
stomach and intestines, and by forming a transient coating on those
organs, enable Nature to resume her healthful sway over the
diseased body. Two, or at most, three eggs per day, would be all
that is required in ordinary cases; and, since the egg is not
merely medicine, but food as well, the lighter the diet otherwise,
and the quieter the patient is kept, the more certain and rapid is
the recovery.</p>
<p>Hot water is better than cold for bruises. It relieves pain
quickly, and by preventing congestion often keeps off the ugly
black and blue mark. "Children cry for it," when they experience
the relief it affords their bumps and bruises.</p>
<p>For a sprained ankle, the whites of eggs and powdered alum made
into a plaster is almost a specific.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MEDICINAL FOOD.</b></p>
<p>Spinach has a direct effect upon complaints of the kidneys; the
common dandelion, used as greens, is excellent for the same
trouble; <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 541]</span><a name='Page_541'
id="Page_541"></a>asparagus purifies the blood; celery acts
admirably upon the nervous system, and is a cure for rheumatism and
neuralgia; tomatoes act upon the liver; beets and turnips are
excellent appetizers; lettuce and cucumbers are cooling in their
effects upon the system; beans are a very nutritious and
strengthening vegetable; while onions, garlic, leeks, chives and
shallots, all of which are similar, possess medicinal virtues of a
marked character, stimulating the circulatory system, and the
consequent increase of the saliva and the gastric juice promoting
digestion. Red onions are an excellent diuretic, and the white ones
are recommended raw as a remedy for insomnia. They are tonic,
nutritious. A soup made from onions is regarded by the French as an
excellent restorative in debility of the digestive organs. We might
go through the entire list and find each vegetable possessing its
especial mission of cure, and it will be plain to every housekeeper
that a vegetable diet should be partly adopted, and will prove of
great advantage to the health of the family.</p>

<h2><b>MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>USES OF AMMONIA.</b></p>
<p>All housekeepers should keep a bottle of liquid ammonia, as it
is the most powerful and useful agent for cleaning silks, stuffs
and hats, in fact cleans everything it touches. A few drops of
ammonia in water will take off grease from dishes, pans, etc., and
does not injure the hands as much as the use of soda and strong
chemical soaps. A spoonful in a quart of warm water for cleaning
paint makes it look like new, and so with everything that needs
cleaning.</p>
<p>Spots on towels and hosiery will disappear with little trouble
if a little ammonia is put into enough water to soak the articles,
and they are left in it an hour or two before washing; and if a
cupful is put into the water in which clothes are soaked the night
before washing, the ease with which the articles can be washed, and
their great whiteness and clearness when dried, will be very
gratifying. Remembering the small sum paid for three quarts of
ammonia of common strength, one can easily see that no bleaching
preparation can be more cheaply obtained.</p>
<p>No articles in kitchen use are so likely to be neglected and
abused as the dish-cloth and dish-towels; and in washing these,
ammonia, if properly used, is a greater comfort than anywhere else.
Put a teaspoonful into the water in which these cloths are, or
should be, washed everyday; rub soap on the towels. Put them in the
water; let them stand half an hour or so; then rub them out
thoroughly, rinse faithfully, and dry outdoors in clear air and
sun, and dish-cloths and towels need never look gray and
dingy&mdash;a perpetual discomfort to all housekeepers.</p>
<p>A dark carpet often looks dusty soon after it has been swept,
and you know it does not need sweeping again; so wet a cloth or a
sponge, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 544]</span><a name='Page_544' id=
"Page_544"></a>wring it almost dry, and wipe off the dust. A few
drops of ammonia in the water will brighten the colors.</p>
<p>For cleaning hair-brushes it is excellent; put a tablespoonful
into the water, having it only tepid, and dip up and down until
clean; then dry with the brushes down and they will be like new
ones.</p>
<p>When employed in washing anything that is not especially soiled,
use the waste water afterward for the house plants that are taken
down from their usual position and immersed in the tub of water.
Ammonia is a fertilizer, and helps to keep healthy the plants it
nourishes. In every way, in fact, ammonia is the housekeeper's
friend.</p>
<p>Ammonia is not only useful for cleaning, but as a household
medicine. Half a teaspoonful taken in half a tumbler of water is
far better for faintness than alcoholic stimulants. In the
Temperance Hospital in London, it is used with the best results. It
was used freely by Lieutenant Greely's Arctic party for keeping up
circulation. It is a relief in nervousness, headache and heart
disturbances.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO DESTROY INSECTS AND VERMIN.</b></p>
<p>Dissolve two pounds of alum in three or four quarts of water.
Let it remain over night till all the alum is dissolved. Then with
a brush, apply boiling hot to every joint or crevice in the closet
or shelves where croton bugs, ants, cockroaches, etc., intrude;
also to the joints and crevices of bedsteads, as bed bugs dislike
it as much as croton bugs, roaches, or ants. Brush all the cracks
in the floor and mop-boards. Keep it boiling hot while using.</p>
<p>To keep woolens and furs from moths, be sure that none are in
the articles when they are put away; then take a piece of strong
brown paper, with not a hole through which even a pin can enter.
Put the article in it with several lumps of gum camphor between the
folds; place this in a close box or trunk. Cover every joint with
paper. A piece of cotton cloth, if thick and firm, will answer.
Wherever a knitting-needle can pass, the parent moth can enter.</p>
<p>Place pieces of camphor, cedar-wood, Russia leather,
tobacco-leaves, whole cloves, or anything strongly aromatic, in the
drawers or boxes where furs and other things to be preserved from
moths are kept and they will never be harmed. Mice never get into
drawers or trunks where gum camphor is placed.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 545]</span><a name='Page_545' id=
"Page_545"></a>
<p><i>Another Recipe</i>.&mdash;Mix half a pint of alcohol, the
same quantity of turpentine and two ounces of camphor. Keep in a
stone bottle and shake well before using. The clothes or furs are
to be wrapped in linen, and crumbled-up pieces of blotting-paper
dipped in the liquid to be placed in the box with them, so that it
smells strong. This requires renewing but once a year.</p>
<p>Another authority says that a positive, sure recipe is this: Mix
equal quantities of pulverized borax, camphor gum and saltpetre
together, making a powder. Sprinkle it dry under the edges of
carpets, in drawers, trunks, etc., etc. It will also keep out all
kinds of insects, if plentifully used. If the housekeeper will
begin at the top of her house with a powder bellows and a large
quantity of this fresh powder, and puff it thoroughly into every
crack and crevice, whether or not there are croton bugs in them, to
the very bottom of her house, special attention being paid to old
furniture, closets, and wherever croton water is introduced, she
will be freed from these torments. The operation may require a
repetition, but the end is success.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOTHS IN CARPETS.</b></p>
<p>If you fear that they are at work at the edge of the carpet, it
will sometimes suffice to lay a wet towel, and press a hot
flat-iron over it; but the best way is to take the carpet up, and
clean it, and give a good deal of attention to the floor. Look in
the cracks, and if you discover signs of moths, wash the floor with
benzine, and scatter red pepper on it before putting the carpet
lining down.</p>
<p>Heavy carpets sometimes do not require taking up every year,
unless in constant use. Take out the tacks from these, fold the
carpets back, wash the floor in strong suds with a tablespoonful of
borax dissolved in it. Dash with insect powder, or lay with tobacco
leaves along the edge, and re-tack. Or use turpentine, the enemy of
buffalo moths, carpet worms and other insects that injure and
destroy carpets. Mix the turpentine with pure water in the
proportion of three tablespoonfuls to three quarts of water, and
then after the carpet has been well swept, go over each breadth
carefully with a sponge dipped in the solution and wrung nearly
dry. Change the water as often as it becomes dirty. The carpet will
be nicely cleaned as well as disinfected. All moths can be kept
away and the eggs destroyed by this means. Spots may be renovated
by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and water.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 546]</span><a name='Page_546' id=
"Page_546"></a>
<p>A good way to brighten a carpet is to put half a tumbler of
spirits of turpentine in a basin of water, and dip your broom in it
and sweep over the carpet once or twice and it will restore the
color and brighten it up until you would think it new. Another good
way to clean old carpets is to rub them over with meal; just dampen
it a very little and rub the carpet with it and when perfectly dry,
sweep over with meal. After a carpet is thoroughly swept, rub it
with a cloth dipped in water and ammonia; it will brighten the
colors and make it look like new.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO TAKE OUT MACHINE GREASE.</b></p>
<p>Cold water, a tablespoonful of ammonia and soap, will take out
machine grease where other means would not answer on account of
colors running, etc.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO WASH FLANNELS.</b></p>
<p>The first thing to consider in washing flannels so that they
retain their size, is that the articles be <i>washed</i> and
<i>rinsed</i> in water of the <i>same temperature</i>, that is,
about as warm as the hands can bear, and not allowed to cool
between. The water should be a strong suds. Bub through two soapy
waters; wring them out, and put into plenty of clear, clean, warm
water to rinse. Then into another of the same temperature, blued a
little. Wring, shake them well and hang up. Do not take out of this
warm water and hang out in a freezing air, as that certainly tends
to shrink them. It is better to dry them in the house, unless the
sun shines. They should dry <i>quickly</i>. Colored flannels should
never be washed in the same water after white clothes, or they will
be covered, when dry, with lint; better be washed in a water for
themselves. In washing worsteds, such as merino dress goods, pursue
the same course, only do not wring them hard; shake, hang them up
and let drain. While a little damp, bring in and press smoothly on
the wrong side with as hot an iron as can be used without scorching
the goods.</p>
<p>Flannels that have become yellow from being badly washed, may be
nicely whitened by soaking them two or three hours in a lather made
of one-quarter of a pound of soft soap, two tablespoonfuls of
powdered borax and two tablespoonfuls of carbonate of ammonia,
dissolved in five or six gallons of water.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 547]</span><a name='Page_547' id=
"Page_547"></a>
<p><b>TO STARCH, FOLD AND IRON SHIRTS.</b></p>
<p>To three tablespoonfuls of dry, fine starch allow a quart of
water. First wet the starch smooth in a little cold water in a tin
pan, put into it a little pinch of salt and a piece of enamel, or
shirt polish the size of a bean, or a piece of clean tallow, or a
piece of butter the size of a cranberry; pour over this a quart of
<i>boiling</i> water, stirring rapidly, placing it over the fire.
Cook until clear, then remove it from the fire and set the pan in
another of warm water to keep the starch warm.</p>
<p>Turn the shirt wrong side out and dip the bosom in the hot
starch as warm as the hands can bear the heat; rub the starch
evenly through the linen, saturating it thoroughly; wring hard to
make dry as possible. Starch the collar and wristbands the same
way, then hang them out to dry. Three hours before ironing them,
wet the bosom and cuffs in cold water, wring out, shake and fold,
roll up tightly, wrap in a towel and let remain two or three
hours.</p>
<p>The back of the shirt should be ironed first by doubling it
lengthwise through the centre, the wristbands may be ironed next,
and both sides of the sleeves, then the collar band; now place a
bosom board under the bosom and with a fresh clean napkin dampened
a little, rub the bosom from the top toward the bottom, arranging
and smoothing each plait neatly; then with a smooth, moderately-hot
flat-iron, begin ironing from the top downward, pressing hard until
the bosom becomes smooth, dry and glossy. Remove the bosom board
and iron the front, fold both sides of the shirt towards the centre
of the back, fold together below the bosom and hang on the bars to
air.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CLEANING OIL-CLOTHS.</b></p>
<p>A dingy oil-cloth may be brightened by washing it with clear
water with a little borax dissolved in it; wipe it with a flannel
cloth that you have dipped into milk and then wring as dry as
possible.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>A teaspoonful of gum arabic dissolved in one teacupful of
boiling water; when cool, add half a teaspoonful of black ink; dip
the lace and spread smoothly between the folds of a newspaper and
press dry with book or the like. Lace shawls can be dressed over in
this way, by pinning a sheet to the carpet and stretching the shawl
upon that; or black lace can be cleaned the same as ribbon and
silk. Take an old <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 548]</span><a name=
'Page_548' id="Page_548"></a>kid glove (black preferable), no
matter how old, and boil it in a pint of water for a short time;
then let it cool until the leather can be taken in the hand without
burning; use the glove to sponge off the ribbon; if the ribbon is
very dirty, dip it into water and draw through the fingers a few
times before sponging. After cleaning, lay a piece of paper over
the ribbon and iron; paper is better than cloth. The ribbon will
look like new.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>Black laces of all kinds may be cleaned by alcohol. Throw them
boldly into the liquid; churn them up and down till they foam; if
very dusty, use the second dose of alcohol; squeeze them out,
"spat" them, pull out the edges, lay them between brown paper,
smooth and straight; leave under a heavy weight till dry; do not
iron.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO WASH WHITE LACE. No. 1.</b></p>
<p>First, the soiled laces should be carefully removed from the
garment and folded a number of times, keeping the edges evenly
together, then basted with a coarse thread without a knot in the
end. Now put them in a basin of luke-warm suds. After soaking a
half hour, rub them carefully between the hands, renewing the suds
several times; then, after soaping them well, place them in
<i>cold</i> water and let them come to a scald. Take them from this
and rinse them thoroughly in luke-warm water, blued a very little,
then dip them into a <i>very thin,</i> clear starch, allowing a
teaspoonful of starch to a pint of water, so thin that it will be
scarcely preceptible. Now roll them in a clean, fresh towel without
taking out the bastings; let them lie for an hour or more, iron
over several thicknesses of flannel, taking out the bastings of one
piece at a time, and ironing on the wrong side, with a
moderately-hot iron; the laces should be nearly dry, and the edges
and points pulled gently with the fingers into shape, before
ironing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO WASH WHITE THREAD LACE. No. 2.</b></p>
<p>To wash white lace, cover a bottle with linen, stitched smoothly
to fit the shape. Wind the lace about it, basting both edges to the
linen. Wash on the bottle, soaping and rinsing well, then boil in
soft water. Dry in the sun. Clip the basting threads and do not
iron. If carefully done it will look like new lace.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 549]</span><a name='Page_549' id=
"Page_549"></a>
<p><b>TO CLEAN SILKS OR RIBBONS.</b></p>
<p>Half a pint of gin, half a pound of honey, half a pound of soft
soap, one-eighth of a pint of water.</p>
<p>Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of
silk upon a clean kitchen table or dresser, and scrub it well on
the soiled side with the mixture. Have ready three vessels of cold
water; take each piece of silk at two corners, and dip it up and
down in each vessel, but do not wring it; and take care that each
breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for the last dip. Hang
it up dripping for a minute or two, then dab in a cloth, and iron
it quickly with a very hot iron.</p>
<p>Where the lace or silk is very much soiled, it is best to pass
them through a warm liquor of bullock's gall and water; rinse in
cold water; then take a small piece of glue, pour boiling water on
it, and pass the veil through it, clap it, and frame to dry.
Instead of framing, it may be fastened with drawing-pins closely
fixed upon a very clean paste, or drawing-board.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLEAN BLACK DRESS SILKS.</b></p>
<p>One of the things "not generally known," at least in this
country, is the Parisian method of cleaning black silk; the
<i>modus operandi</i> is very simple, and the result infinitely
superior to that achieved in any other manner. The silk must be
thoroughly brushed and wiped with a cloth, then laid flat on a
board or table, and well sponged with hot coffee, thoroughly freed
from sediment by being strained through muslin. The silk is sponged
on the side intended to show; it is allowed to become partially
dry, and then ironed on the wrong side. The coffee removes every
particle of grease, and restores the brilliancy of silk, without
imparting to it either the shiny appearance or crackly and papery
stiffness obtained by beer, or, indeed, any other liquid. The silk
really appears thickened by the process, and this good effect is
permanent. Our readers who will experimentalize on an apron or
cravat, will never again try any other method.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO WASH FEATHERS.</b></p>
<p>Wash in warm soap-suds and rinse in water a very little blued;
if the feather is white, then let the wind dry it. When the curl
has come out by washing the feather or getting it damp, place a hot
flat-iron so that you can hold the feather just above it while
curling. Take <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 550]</span><a name=
'Page_550' id="Page_550"></a>a bone or silver knife, and draw the
fibres of the feather between the thumb and the dull edge of the
knife, taking not more than three fibres at a time, beginning at
the point of the feather and curling one-half the other way. The
hot iron makes the curl more durable. After a little practice one
can make them look as well as new feathers. Or they can be curled
by holding them over the stove or range, not near enough to burn;
withdraw and shake out; then hold them over again until they curl.
When swansdown becomes soiled, it can be washed and look as good as
new. Tack strips on a piece of muslin and wash in warm water with
white soap, then rinse and hang in the wind to dry. Rip from the
muslin and rub carefully between the fingers to soften the
leather.</p>
<br>
<p><b>INCOMBUSTIBLE DRESSES.</b></p>
<p>By putting an ounce of alum or sal ammoniac in the <i>last</i>
water in which muslins or cottons are rinsed, or a similar quantity
in the starch in which they are stiffened, they will be rendered
almost uninflammable; or, at least, will with difficulty take the
fire, and if they do, will burn without flame. It is astonishing
that this simple precaution is so rarely adopted. Remember this and
save the lives of your children.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO FRESHEN UP FURS.</b></p>
<p>Furs when taken out in the fall are often found to have a
mussed, crushed-out appearance. They can be made to look like new,
by following these simple directions: Wet the fur with a
hair-brush, brushing up the wrong way of the fur. Leave it to dry
in the air for about half an hour, and then give it a good beating
on the right side with a rattan. After beating it, comb it with a
coarse comb, combing up the right way of the fur.</p>
<br>
<p><b>NOVEL DRESS MENDING.</b></p>
<p>A novel way of mending a woolen or silk dress in which a round
hole has been torn, and where only a patch could remedy matters, is
the following: The frayed portions around the tear should be
carefully smoothed, and a piece of the material, moistened with
very thin muscilage, placed under the hole. A heavy weight should
be put upon it until it is dry, when it is only possible to
discover the mended place by careful observation.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 551]</span><a name='Page_551' id=
"Page_551"></a>
<p><b>TO RENEW OLD CRAPE.</b></p>
<p>Place a little water in a tea-kettle, and let it boil until
there is plenty of steam from the spout; then, holding the crape in
both hands, pass it to and fro several times through the steam, and
it will be clean and look nearly equal to new.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO RAISE THE PILE ON VELVET.</b></p>
<p>To raise the pile on velvet, put on a table two pieces of wood;
place between them, bottom side up, three very hot flat-irons, and
over them lay a wet cloth; hold the velvet over the cloth, with the
wrong side down; when thoroughly steamed, brush the pile with a
light wisp, and the velvet will look as good as new.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO CLEAN KID GLOVES.</b></p>
<p>Make a thick mucilage by boiling a handful of flax-seed; add a
little dissolved toilet soap; then, when the mixture cools, put the
gloves on the hands and rub them with a piece of white flannel wet
with the mixture. Do not wet the gloves through. Or take a fine,
clean, soft cloth, dip it into a little sweet milk, then rub it on
a cake of soap, and rub the gloves with it; they will, look like
new.</p>
<p>Another good way to clean any color of kid gloves is to pour a
little benzine into a basin and wash the gloves in it, rubbing and
squeezing them until clean. If much soiled, they must be washed
through clean benzine, and rinsed in a fresh supply. Hang up in the
air to dry.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STARCH POLISH.</b></p>
<p>Take one ounce of spermaceti and one ounce of white wax; melt
and run it into a thin cake on a plate. A piece the size of a
quarter dollar added to a quart of prepared starch gives a
beautiful lustre to the clothes and prevents the iron from
sticking.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FOR CLEANING JEWELRY.</b></p>
<p>For cleaning jewelry there is nothing better than ammonia and
water. If very dull or dirty, rub a little soap on a soft brush and
brush them in this wash, rinse in cold water, dry first in an old
handkerchief and then rub with buck or chamois skin. Their
freshness and brilliancy when thus cleaned cannot be surpassed by
any compound used by jewelers.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 552]</span><a name='Page_552' id=
"Page_552"></a>
<p><b>TO CLEAN SILVER PLATE.</b></p>
<p>Wash well in strong, warm soap-suds, rinse and wipe dry with a
dry soft cloth; then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be
required into a thick paste, with cold water; spread this over the
silver, with a soft cloth, and leave it for a little time to dry.
When perfectly dry brush it off with a clean soft cloth, or brush
and polish it with a piece of chamois skin. Hartshorn is one of the
best possible ingredients for plate powder for daily use. It leaves
on the silver a deep, dark polish, and at the same time does not
injure it. Whiting, dampened with liquid ammonia, is excellent
also.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO REMOVE STAINS FROM MARBLE.</b></p>
<p>Mix together one-half pound of soda, one-half pound of soft soap
and one pound of whiting. Boil them until they become as thick as
paste, and let it cool. Before it is quite cold, spread it over the
surface of the marble and leave it at least a whole day. Use soft
water to wash it off, and rub it well with soft cloths. For a black
marble, nothing it better than spirits of turpentine.</p>
<p>Another paste answers the same purpose: Take two parts of soda,
one of pumice stone and one of finely-powdered chalk. Sift these
through a fine sieve and mix them into a paste with water. Rub this
well all over the marble and the stains will be removed; then wash
it with soap and water and a beautiful bright polish will be
produced.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO WHITEN WALLS.</b></p>
<p>To whiten walls, scrape off all the old whitewash, and wash the
walls with a solution of two ounces of white vitriol to four
gallons of water. Soak a quarter of a pound of white glue in water
for twelve hours; strain and place in a tin pail in a kettle of
boiling water. When melted, stir in the glue eight pounds of
whiting and water enough to make it as thick as common whitewash.
Apply evenly with a good brush. If the walls are very yellow, blue
the water slightly by squeezing in it a flannel blue-bag.</p>
<p>Before kalsomining a wall all cracks should be plastered over.
Use plaster of Paris. Kalsomine may be colored easily by mixing
with it yellow ochre, Spanish brown, indigo; squeeze through a bag
into the water, etc.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 553]</span><a name='Page_553' id=
"Page_553"></a>
<p><b>PAPER-HANGERS' PASTE.</b></p>
<p>To make paper-hangers' paste, beat up four pounds of good, white
wheat flour (well sifted previously) in sufficient cold water to
form a stiff batter. Beat it well in order to take out all lumps,
and then add enough cold water to make the mixture of the
consistency of pudding batter. To this add about two ounces of
well-pounded alum. Pour gently and quickly over the batter boiling
water, stirring rapidly at the same time, and when it is seen to
lose the white color of the flour, it is cooked and ready. Do not
use it, however, while hot, but allow it to cool. Pour about a pint
of cold water over the top to prevent a skin from forming. Before
using, the paste should be thinned by the addition of cold
water.</p>

<p><b>TO WASH COLORED GARMENTS.</b></p>
<p>Delicately colored socks and stockings are apt to fade in
washing. If they are soaked for a night in a pail of tepid water
containing a half pint of turpentine, then wrung out and dried, the
colors will "set," and they can afterwards be washed without
fading.</p>
<p>For calicoes that fade, put a teaspoonful of sugar of lead into
a pailful of water and soak the garment fifteen minutes before
washing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE MARKING SYSTEM.</b></p>
<p>Mark all your own personal wardrobe which has to be washed. If
this were invariably done, a great deal of property would be saved
and a great deal of trouble would be spared. For the sake of saving
trouble to others, if for no other reason, all of one's
handkerchiefs, collars and underclothing should be plainly and
permanently marked. A bottle of indelible ink is cheap, a clean pen
still cheaper, and a bright, sunny day or a hot flat-iron will
complete the business. Always keep on hand a stick of linen tape,
written over its whole length with your name, or the names of your
family, ready to be cut off and sewed on to stockings and such
other articles as do not afford a good surface on which to
mark.</p>
<p>Then there are the paper patterns, of which every mother has a
store. On the outside of each, as it is tied up, the name of the
pattern should be plainly written. There are the rolls of pieces,
which may contain a good deal not apparent from the outside. All
these hidden mysteries should be indicated. The winter things,
which are <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 554]</span><a name='Page_554'
id="Page_554"></a>wrapped up and put away for summer, and the
summer things, which are wrapped up and put away for the winter,
should all be in labeled packages, and every packing trunk should
have on its lid a complete list of its contents.</p>

<p><b>TO REMOVE STAINS AND SPOTS.</b></p>
<p>Children's clothes, table linens, towels, etc., should be
thoroughly examined before wetting, as soap-suds, washing-fluids,
etc., will fix almost any stain past removal. Many stains will pass
away by being simply washed in pure, soft water; or alcohol will
remove, before the article has been in soap-suds, many stains; iron
mold, mildew, or almost any similar spot, can be taken out by
dipping in diluted citric acid; then cover with salt and lay in the
bright sun till the stain disappears. If of long standing, it may
be necessary to repeat the wetting and the sunlight. Be careful to
rinse in several waters as soon as the stain is no longer visible.
Ink, fruit, wine, and mildew stains must first be washed in clear,
cold water, removing as much of the spots as can be, then mix one
teaspoonful of oxalic acid and a half pint of rain-water. Dip the
stain in this and wipe off in clear water. Wash at once, if a
fabric that will bear washing. A tablespoonful of white currant
juice, if any can be had, is even better than lemon. This
preparation may be used on the most delicate articles without
injury. Shake it up before using it. Mark it "poison," and put it
where it will not be meddled with.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OIL STAINS IN SILKS AND OTHER FABRICS.</b></p>
<p>Benzine is most effectual, not only for silk, but for any other
material whatever. It can be procured from any druggist. By simply
covering both sides of greased silk with magnesia, and allowing it
to remain for a few hours, the oil is absorbed by the powder.
Should the first application be insufficient, it may be repeated,
and even rubbed in with the hand. Should the silk be Tussah or
Indian silk, it will wash.</p>
<p>To remove an acid stain on violet silk: Brush the discoloration
with tincture of iodine, then saturate the spot well with a
solution of hyposulphite of soda, and dry gradually. This restores
the original color perfectly.</p>
<p>Muriatic acid is successfully used for removing ink stains and
iron mold on a number of colors which it does not attack.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 555]</span><a name='Page_555' id=
"Page_555"></a>
<p>Sulphurous acid is only employed for whitening undyed goods,
straw hats, etc., and for removing the stains of certain fruits on
silks and woolens. Sulphurous gas is also used for this purpose,
but the liquid gas is safer.</p>
<p>Oxalic acid is used for removing ink and rust stains, and
remnants of mud stains, which do not yield to other deterrents. It
may also be used for destroying the stains of fruits and astringent
juices, and old stains of urine. However, its use is limited to
white goods, as it attacks fugitive colors and even light shades of
those reputed to be fast. The best method of applying it is to
dissolve it in cold or luke-warm water, to let it remain a moment
upon the spot, and then rub it with the fingers. Wash out in clear,
warm water immediately.</p>
<p>Citric acid serves to revive and brighten certain colors,
especially greens and yellows. It restores scarlets which have been
turned to a crimson by the action of alkalies. Acetic acid or
tartaric acid may be used instead.</p>
<p>Where it is feared that soap may change the color of an article,
as, for instance, scarlet hosiery or lilac print, if the garment be
not badly soiled, it may be cleansed by washing without soap in
water in which pared potatoes have been boiled. This method will
also prevent color from running in washing prints.</p>
<p>To prevent blue from running into a white ground, dissolve a
teaspoonful of copperas in a pailful of soft water, add a piece of
lime the size of an acorn, and soak the garments in this water two
hours before washing. To keep colors from running in washing black
prints, put a teaspoon of black pepper in the first water.</p>
<p>Salt or beef's gall in the water helps to set black. A
tablespoonful of spirits of turpentine to a gallon of water sets
most blues, and alum is very efficacious in setting green. Black or
very dark calicoes should be stiffened with gum arabic&mdash;five
cents' worth is enough for a dress. If, however, starch is used,
the garment should be turned wrong side out.</p>
<p>A simple way to remove grass stains is to spread butter on them,
and lay the article in hot sunshine, or wash in alcohol. Fruit
stains upon cloth or the hands may be removed by rubbing with the
juice of ripe tomatoes. If applied immediately, powdered starch
will also take fruit stains out of table linen. Left on the spot
for a few hours, it absorbs every trace of the stain.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 556]</span><a name='Page_556' id=
"Page_556"></a>
<p>For mildew stains or iron rust, mix together soft soap, laundry
starch, half as much salt, and the juice of a lemon. Apply to the
spots and spread the garment on the grass. Or wet the linen, rub
into it white soap, then finely powdered chalk; lay upon the grass
and keep damp. Old mildew stains may be removed by rubbing yellow
soap on both sides and afterwards laying on, very thick, starch
which has been dampened. Rub in well and expose to light and air.
There are several effectual methods of removing grease from cloths.
First, wet with a linen cloth dipped in chloroform. Second, mix
four tablespoonfuls of alcohol with one tablespoonful of salt;
shake together until the salt is dissolved and apply with a sponge.
Third, wet with weak ammonia water; then lay a thin white blotting
or tissue paper over it and iron lightly with an iron not too hot.
Fourth, apply a mixture of equal parts of alcohol, gin and
ammonia.</p>
<p>Candle grease yields to a warm iron. Place a piece of blotting
or other absorbing paper under the absorbing fabric; put a piece of
the paper also on the spot, apply the warm iron to the paper and as
soon as a spot of grease appears, move the paper and press again
until the spot disappears. Lard will remove wagon grease. Rub the
spot with the lard as if washing it, and when it is well out, wash
in the ordinary way with soap and water until thoroughly
cleansed.</p>
<p>To make linen beautifully white, prepare the water for washing
by putting into every ten gallons a large handful of powdered borax
or boil with the clothes one teaspoonful of spirits of
turpentine.</p>
<p>Fruit stains may be taken out by boiling water. Place the
material over a basin or other vessel and pour the boiling water
from the kettle over the stains.</p>
<p>Pure water, cold or hot, mixed with acids, serves for rinsing
goods in order to remove foreign and neutral bodies which cover the
color. Steam softens fatty matters and thus facilitates their
removal by reagents.</p>
<p>Sulphuric acid may be used in certain cases, particularly for
brightening and raising greens, reds, yellows, etc., but it must be
diluted with at least one hundred times its weight of water and
more in cases of delicate shades.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CEMENT FOR CHINA AND GLASS.</b></p>
<p>To half a pint of milk put an equal quantity of vinegar in order
to curdle it; then separate the curd from the whey and mix the whey
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 557]</span><a name='Page_557' id=
"Page_557"></a>with the whites of four or five eggs, beating the
whole well together. When it is well-mixed, add a little
quick-lime, through a sieve, until it has acquired the consistency
of a thick paste. With this cement broken vessels and cracks of all
kinds may be mended. It dries quickly and resists the action of
fire and water.</p>
<p>Another: Into a thick solution of gum arabic, stir plaster of
Paris until the mixture assumes the consistency of cream; apply
with a brush to the broken edges of china and join together. In
three days the article cannot be broken in the same place. The
whiteness of the cement adds to its value.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CLEANING SINKS.</b></p>
<p>To purify greasy sinks and pipes, pour down a pailful of boiling
water in which three or four pounds of washing soda have been
dissolved. A disinfectant is prepared in the same way, using
copperas. Copperas is a poison and should not be left about.</p>
<p><i>Leaks in Waste Pipes:</i>&mdash;Shut yourself into a room
from which the pipe starts. Put two or three ounces of oil of
peppermint into a pail of boiling hot water and pour down the pipe.
Another person who has not yet inhaled the strong odor should
follow the course of the pipe through the house. The peppermint
will be pretty sure to discover a break that even an expert plumber
might overlook.</p>

<br>
<p><b>MANAGEMENT OF STOVES.</b></p>
<p>If the fire in a stove has plenty of fresh coals on top not yet
burned through it will need only a little shaking to start it up;
but if the fire looks dying and the coals look white, don't shake
it. When it has drawn till it is red again, if there is much ash
and little fire, put coals on very carefully. A mere handful of
fire can be coaxed back into life by adding another handful or so
of new coals on the red spot, and giving plenty of draught, but
don't shake a dying fire, or you lose it. This management is often
necessary after a warm spell, when the stove has been kept dormant
for days, though I hope you will not be so unfortunate as to have a
fire to coax up on a cold winter morning. They should be arranged
over night, so that all that is required is to open the draughts in
order to have a cherry glow in a few minutes.</p>

<p><b>TO REMOVE INK FROM CARPETS.</b></p>
<p>When freshly spilled, ink can be removed from carpets by wetting
in milk. Take cotton batting and soak up all the ink that it will
receive, being careful not to let it spread. Then take fresh
cotton, wet in milk, and sop it up carefully. Repeat this
operation, changing cotton and milk each time. After most of the
ink has been taken up in this way, with fresh cotton and clean, rub
the spot. Continue till all disappears; then wash the spot in clean
warm water and a little soap; rinse in clear water and rub till
nearly dry. If the ink is dried in, we know of no way that will not
take the color from the carpet as well as the ink, unless the ink
is on a white spot. In that case, salts of lemon, or soft soap,
starch and lemon juice, will remove the ink as easily as if on
cotton.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO TAKE RUST OUT OF STEEL.</b></p>
<p>If possible, place the article in a bowl containing kerosene
oil, or wrap the steel up in a soft cloth well saturated with
kerosene; let it remain twenty-four hours or longer, then scour the
rusty spots with brick dust; if badly rusted, use salt wet with hot
vinegar; after scouring rinse every particle of brick dust or salt
off with boiling hot water; dry thoroughly with flannel cloths and
place near the fire to make sure, then polish off with a clean
flannel cloth and a little sweet oil.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE A PASTE OR MUCILAGE TO FASTEN LABLES.</b></p>
<p>Soften good glue in water, then boil it with strong vinegar and
thicken the liquid, during boiling, with fine wheat flour, so that
a paste results; or starch paste with which a little Venice
turpentine has been incorporated while it was warm.</p>
<p>A recipe for a transparent cement which possesses great tenacity
and has not the slightest yellow tinge: Mix in a well-stoppered
bottle ten drachms of chloroform with ten and one-half of
non-vulcanized caoutchouc (rubber) cut in small pieces. Solution is
readily effected and when it is completed add two and one-half
drachms of mastic. Let the whole macerate from eight to ten days
without the application of any heat and shake the contents of the
bottle at intervals. A perfectly white and very adhesive cement is
the result.</p>

<p><b>POSTAGE STAMP MUCILAGE.</b></p>
<p>Take of gum dextrine two parts, acetic acid one part, water five
parts. Dissolve in a water bath and add alcohol one part.</p>
<div class='right'><i>Scientific American.</i></div>
<p>Gum of great strength, which will also keep for a long time, is
prepared by dissolving equal parts of gum arabic and gum tragacanth
in vinegar. A little vinegar added to ordinary gum water will make
it keep much better.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FAMILY GLUE.</b></p>
<p>Crack the glue and put it in a bottle, add common whisky; shake
up, cork tight, and in three or four days it can be used. It
requires no heating, will keep for almost any length of time, and
is at all times, ready to use, except in the coldest of weather,
when it will require warming. It must be kept tight, so that the
whisky will not evaporate. The usual corks or stoppers should not
be used. It will become clogged. A tin stopper covering the bottle,
but fitting as closely as possible, must be used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GLUE.</b></p>
<p>Glue to resist <i>heat</i> and <i>moisture</i> is made as
follows: Mix a handful of quick-lime in four ounces of linseed oil,
boil to a good thickness, then spread it on tin plates in the
shade, and it will become very hard, but may be easily dissolved
over the fire as glue.</p>
<p>A glue which will resist the action of water is made by boiling
one pound of common glue in two quarts of skimmed milk.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FURNITURE CREAM.</b></p>
<p>Shred finely two ounces of beeswax and half an ounce of white
wax into half a pint of turpentine; set in a warm place until
dissolved, then pour over the mixture the following, boiled
together until melted: Half a pint of water, an ounce of castile
soap and a piece or resin the size of a small nutmeg. Mix
thoroughly and keep in a wide-necked stone bottle for use. This
cleans well and leaves a good polish, and may be made at a fourth
of the price it is sold at.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CEMENT CRACKS IN FLOOR.</b></p>
<p>Cracks in floors may be neatly but permanently filled by
thoroughly soaking newspapers in paste made of half a pound of
flour, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 560]</span><a name='Page_560' id=
"Page_560"></a>three quarts of water and half a pound of alum mixed
and boiled. The mixture will be about as thick as putty, and may be
forced into the crevice with a case knife. It will harden like
papier-mache.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A POLISH FOR LADIES' KID SHOES.</b></p>
<p>A fine liquid polish for ladies' kid shoes, satchels, etc., that
is easy of application, recommended as containing no ingredients in
any manner injurious to leather, is found by digesting in a closed
vessel at gentle heat, and straining, a solution made as follows:
Lampblack one drachm, oil turpentine four drachms, alcohol
(trymethyl) twelve ounces, shellac one and one-half ounces, white
turpentine five drachms, saudarac two drachms.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PASTE FOR SCRAP BOOKS, ETC.</b></p>
<p><i>Paste that Will Keep</i>.&mdash;Dissolve a teaspoonful of
alum in a quart of water. When cold, stir in flour, to give it the
consistency of thick cream, being particular to beat up all the
lumps. Stir in as much powdered resin as will lie on a dime, and
throw in half a dozen cloves to give it a pleasant odor. Have on
the fire a teacupful of boiling water; pour the flour mixture into
it, stirring well all the time. In a few minutes it will be of the
consistency of molasses. Pour it into an earthen or china vessel,
let it cool, and stir in a small teaspoonful each of oil of cloves
and of sassafras; lay a cover on, and put in a cool place. When
needed for use, take out a portion and soften it with warm water.
This is a fine paste to use to stiffen embroidery.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO REMOVE INDELIBLE INK.</b></p>
<p>Most indelible inks contain nitrate of silver, the stain of
which may be removed by first soaking in a solution of common salt,
and afterward washing with ammonia. Or use solution of ten grains
of cyanide of potassium and five grains of iodine to one ounce of
water, or a solution of eight parts each bichloride of mercury and
chloride of ammonium in one hundred and twenty-five parts of
water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A CEMENT FOR ACIDS.</b></p>
<p>A cement which is proof against boiling acids may be made by a
composition of India rubber, tallow, lime and red lead. The India
rubber must first be melted by a gentle heat, and then six to eight
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 561]</span><a name='Page_561' id=
"Page_561"></a>per cent by weight of tallow is added to the mixture
while it is kept well stirred; next day slaked lime is applied,
until the fluid mass assumes a consistency similar to that of soft
paste; lastly, twenty per cent of red lead is added in order to
make it harden and dry.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO KEEP CIDER.</b></p>
<p>Allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar to the gallon, the
whites of six eggs, well beaten, a handful of common salt. Leave it
open until fermentation ceases, then bung up. This process a dealer
of cider has used for years, and always successfully.</p>
<p><i>Another Recipe</i>.&mdash;To keep cider sweet allow it to
work until it has reached the state most desirable to the taste,
and then add one and a half tumblers of grated horse-radish to each
barrel, and shake up well. This arrests further fermentation. After
remaining a few weeks, rack off and bung up closely in clean
casks.</p>
<p>A gentleman of Denver writes he has a sure preservative: Put
eight gallons of cider at a time into a clean barrel; take one
ounce of powdered charcoal and one ounce of powdered sulphur; mix
and put it into some iron vessel that will go down through the
bung-hole of the barrel. Now put a piece of red-hot iron into the
charcoal and sulphur, and while it is burning, lower it through the
bung-hole to within one foot of the cider, and suspend it there by
a piece of wire. Bring it up and in twelve hours you can cure
another batch. Put the cider in a tight barrel and keep in a cool
cellar and it will keep for years.</p>
<p><i>A Holland Recipe</i>.&mdash;To one quart of new milk, fresh
from the cow (not strained), add one half pound of ground black
mustard seed and six eggs. Beat the whole well together and pour
into a barrel of cider. It will keep cider sweet for one year or
more.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO BLEACH COTTON CLOTH.</b></p>
<p>Take one large spoonful of sal soda and one pound of chloride
lime for thirty yards; dissolve in clean, soft water; rinse the
cloth thoroughly in cold, soft water so that it may not rot. This
amount of cloth may be bleached in fourteen or fifteen minutes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>A POLISH FOR LEATHER.</b></p>
<p>Put a half-pound of shellac broken up in small pieces into a
quart bottle or jug, cover it with alcohol, cork it tight, and put
it on the shelf <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 562]</span><a name=
'Page_562' id="Page_562"></a>in a warm place; shake it well several
times a day, then add a piece of camphor as large as a hen's egg;
shake it well, and in a few hours shake it again and add one ounce
of lampblack. If the alcohol is good, it will all be dissolved in
two days; then shake and use. If the materials were of the proper
kind, the polish correctly prepared, it will dry in about five
minutes, giving a gloss equal to patent leather. Using aniline dyes
instead of the lampblack, you can have it any desired color, and it
can be used on wood or hard paper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO SOFTEN WATER.</b></p>
<p>Add half a pound of the best quick-lime dissolved in water to
every hundred gallons. Smaller proportions may be more conveniently
managed, and if allowed to stand a short time the lime will have
united with the carbonate of lime, and been deposited at the bottom
of the receptacle. Another way is to put a gallon of lye into a
barrelful of water, or two or three shovelfuls of wood-ashes, let
stand over night; it will be clear and soft.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WASHING FLUID.</b></p>
<p>One gallon of water and four pounds of ordinary washing soda,
and a quarter of a pound of soda. Heat the water to boiling hot,
put in the soda, boil about five minutes, then pour it over two
pounds of unslaked lime, let it bubble and foam until it settles,
turn it off and bottle it for use. This is the article that is used
in the Chinese laundries for whitening their linen, and is called
"Javelle water;" a tablespoonful put into a suds of three gallons,
and a little, say a quarter of a cupful, in the boiler when boiling
the clothes, makes them very white and clear. Must be well rinsed
afterwards. This preparation will remove tea stains and almost all
ordinary stains of fruit, grass, etc. This fluid brightens the
colors of colored clothes, does not rot them, but should not be
<i>left long in any water</i>; the boiling, sudsing, rinsing and
bluing, should be done in quick succession, until the clothes are
ready to hang on the line.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HARD SOAP. (Washing.)</b></p>
<p>Six pounds of washing soda and three of unslaked lime. Pour on
four gallons of boiling water, let it stand until perfectly clear,
then drain off, and put in six pounds of clean fat. Boil it until
it begins <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 563]</span><a name='Page_563'
id="Page_563"></a>to harden, about two hours, stirring most of the
time. While boiling, thin it with two gallons of cold water, which
you have previously poured on the alkaline mixture, after draining
off the four gallons. This must be settled clear before it is drawn
off. Add it when there is danger of boiling over. Try the thickness
by cooling a little on a plate. Put in a handful of salt just
before taking from the fire. Wet a tub to prevent sticking; turn in
the soap and let it stand until solid. Cut into bars, put on a
board and let it dry. This makes about forty pounds of soap. It can
be flavored just as you turn it out.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOAP FOR WASHING WITHOUT RUBBING.</b></p>
<p>A soap to clean clothes without rubbing: Take two pounds of sal
soda, two pounds of common bar soap and ten quarts of water. Cut
the soap in thin slices and boil together two hours; strain and it
will be fit for use. Put the clothes in soak the night before you
wash, and to every pailful of water in which you boil them add a
pound of soap. They will need no rubbing, but merely rinsing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO MAKE SOFT SOAP WITHOUT COOKING.</b></p>
<p>Pour two pailfuls of boiling water upon twenty pounds of potash
and let it stand two hours. Have ready thirty pounds of clean
grease, upon which pour one pailful of the lye, adding another pail
of water to the potash; let it stand three or four hours, stir it
well; then pour a gallon of the lye upon the grease, stir it well;
and in half an hour another gallon of the lye, stir it thoroughly;
in half an hour repeat the process, and thus proceed until you have
poured off all the lye; then add two pails of boiling hot water to
the remainder of the potash, and let it stand ten hours; then stir
the mixture, and if it has become stiff and the grease has
disappeared from the surface, take out a little and see whether the
weak lye will thicken it; if it does, add the lye; if it does not,
try water, and if that thickens it, let it stand another day,
stirring it well five or six times during the day; if the lye does
not separate from the grease you may fill up with water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OLD-STYLE FAMILY SOFT SOAP.</b></p>
<p>To <i>set the leach</i>, bore several holes in the bottom of a
barrel, or use one without a bottom; prepare a board larger than
the barrel, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 564]</span><a name='Page_564'
id="Page_564"></a>then set the barrel on it, and cut a groove
around just outside the barrel, making one groove from this to the
edge of the board, to carry off the lye as it runs off, with a
groove around it, running into one in the centre of the board.
Place all two feet from the ground and tip it so that the lye may
run easily from the board into the vessel below prepared to receive
it. Put half bricks or stones around the edge of the inside of the
barrel; place on them one end of some sticks about two inches wide,
inclining to the centre; on those place some straw to the depth of
two inches, over it scatter two pounds of slaked lime. Put in
ashes, about half of a bushel at a time, pack it well, by pounding
it down, and continue doing so until the barrel is full, leaving a
funnel-shaped hollow in the centre large enough to hold several
quarts of water. Use rain-water boiling hot. Let the water
disappear before adding more. If the ashes are packed very
<i>tightly</i> it may require two or three days before the lye will
begin to run, but it will be the stronger for it, and much
better.</p>
<p><i>To Make Boiled Soft Soap</i>.&mdash;Put in a kettle the
grease consisting of all kinds of fat that has accumulated in the
kitchen, such as scraps and bones from the soup-kettle, rinds from
meat, etc.; fill the kettle half full; if there is too much grease
it can be skimmed off after the soap is cold, for another kettle of
soap. This is the only true test when enough grease is used, as the
lye will consume all that is needed and no more. Make a fire under
one side of it. The kettle should be in an out-house or out of
doors. Let it heat very hot so as to fry; stir occasionally to
prevent burning. Now put in the lye a gallon at a time, watching it
closely until it boils, as it sometimes runs over at the beginning.
Add lye until the kettle is full enough, but not <i>too full to
boil well</i>. Soap should boil from the <i>side</i> and not the
middle, as this would be more likely to cause it to boil over. To
test the soap, to one spoonful of soap add one of rain-water; if it
stirs up very thick, the soap is good and will keep; if it becomes
thinner, it is not good. This is the result of one of three causes,
either it is too weak, or there is a deposit of dirt or it is too
strong. Continue to boil for a few hours, when it should flow from
the stick with which it is stirred like thick molasses; but if
after boiling it remains thin, let it stand over night, removing it
from the fire, then drain it off very <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
565]</span><a name='Page_565' id="Page_565"></a>carefully into
another vessel, being very particular to prevent any sediment from
passing. Wash the kettle, return the soap and boil again, if dirt
was the cause; it will now be thick and good; otherwise if it was
<i>too strong</i>, rain-water added will make it right, adding the
water gradually until right and just thick enough.</p>

<h2><b>FACTS WORTH KNOWING.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><i>An Agreeable Disinfectant:</i>&mdash;Sprinkle fresh ground
coffee on a shovel of hot coals, or burn sugar on hot coals.
Vinegar boiled with myrrh, sprinkled on the floor and furniture of
a sick room, is an excellent deodorizer.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Mold:</i>&mdash;A small quantity of carbolic acid
added to paste, mucilage and ink, will prevent mold. An ounce of
the acid to a gallon of whitewash will keep cellars and dairies
from the disagreeable odor which often taints milk and meat kept in
such places.</p>
<p><i>To Make Tracing-Paper:</i>&mdash;Dissolve a ball of white
beeswax, one inch in diameter, in half a pint of turpentine.
Saturate the paper in this bath and let it dry two or three days
before using.</p>
<p><i>To Preserve Brooms:</i>&mdash;Dip them for a minute or two in
a kettle of boiling suds once a week and they will last much
longer, making them tough and pliable. A carpet wears much longer
swept with a broom cared for in this manner.</p>
<p><i>To Clean Brass-Ware, etc.:</i>&mdash;Mix one ounce of oxalic
acid, six ounces of rotten stone, all in powder, one ounce of sweet
oil, and sufficient water to make a paste. Apply a small portion,
and rub dry with a flannel or leather. The liquid dip most
generally used consists of nitric and sulphuric acids; but this is
more corrosive.</p>
<p><i>Polish or Enamel for Shirt Bosoms</i> is made by melting
together one ounce of white wax, and two ounces of spermaceti; heat
gently and turn into a very shallow pan; when cold cut or break in
pieces. When making boiled starch the usual way, enough for a dozen
bosoms, add to it a piece of the polish the size of a hazel
nut.</p>
<p><i>An Erasive Fluid for the Removal of Spots on Furniture</i>,
and all kinds of fabrics, without injuring the color, is made of
four ounces of aqua ammonia, one ounce of glycerine, one ounce of
castile soap and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 567]</span><a name=
'Page_567' id="Page_567"></a>one of spirits of wine. Dissolve the
soap in two quarts of soft water, add the other ingredients. Apply
with a soft sponge and rub out. Very good for deaning silks.</p>
<p><i>To Remove the Odor of Onion</i> from fish-kettle and
saucepans in which they have been cooked, put wood-ashes or sal
soda, potash or lye; fill with water and let it stand on the stove
until it boils; then wash in hot suds, and rinse well.</p>
<p><i>To Clean Marble Busts:</i>&mdash;First free them from all
dust, then wash them with very weak hydrochloric acid. Soap injures
the color of marble.</p>
<p><i>To Remove old Putty from Window Frames</i>, pass a red hot
poker slowly over it and it will come off easily.</p>
<p><i>Hanging Pictures:</i>&mdash;The most safe material and also
the best, is copper wire, of the size proportioned to the weight of
the picture. When hung the wire is scarcely visible, and its
strength is far superior to cord.</p>
<p><i>To Keep Milk Sweet:&mdash;</i>Put into a panful a spoonful of
grated horse-radish, it will keep it sweet for days.</p>
<p><i>To Take Rust from Steel Implements or Knives:&mdash;</i>Rub
them well with kerosene oil, leaving them covered with it a day or
so; then rub them hard and well with finely powdered unslaked
lime.</p>
<p><i>Poison Water:&mdash;</i>Water boiled in galvanized iron
becomes poisonous, and cold water passed through zinc-lined iron
pipes should never be used for cooking or drinking. Hot water for
cooking should never be taken from hot water pipes; keep a supply
heated in kettles.</p>
<p><i>Scouring Soap for Cotton and Silk Goods:</i>&mdash;Mix one
pound of common soap, half a pound of beef-gall and one ounce and a
half of Venetian turpentine.</p>
<p><i>A Paint for Wood or Stone that Resists all
Moisture:</i>&mdash;Melt twelve ounces of resin; mix with it,
thoroughly, six gallons of fish oil and one pound of melted
sulphur. Rub up some ochre or any other coloring substance with a
little linseed oil, enough to give it the right, color and
thickness. Apply several coats of the hot composition with a brush.
The first coat should be very thin.</p>
<p><i>To Ventilate a Room:</i>&mdash;Place a pitcher of cold water
on a table in your room and it will absorb all the gases with which
the room is filled from the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
568]</span><a name='Page_568' id="Page_568"></a>respiration of
those eating or sleeping in the apartment. Very few realize how
important such purification is for the health of the family, or,
indeed, understand or realize that there can be any impurity in the
rooms; yet in a few hours a pitcher or pail of cold water&mdash;the
colder the more effective&mdash;will make the air of a room pure,
but the water will be entirely unfit for use.</p>
<p><i>To Fill Cracks in Plaster:</i>&mdash;Use vinegar instead of
water to mix your plaster of Paris. The resultant mass will be like
putty, and will not "set" for twenty or thirty minutes; whereas, if
you use water the plaster will become hard almost immediately,
before you have time to use it. Push it into the cracks and smooth
it off nicely with a table knife.</p>
<p><i>To Take Spots from Wash Goods:</i>&mdash;Rub them with the
yolk of egg before washing.</p>
<p><i>To Take White Spots from Varnished Furniture:</i>&mdash;Hold
a hot stove lid or plate over them and they will soon
disappear.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Oil from Becoming Rancid:</i>&mdash;Drop a few
drops of ether into the bottle containing it.</p>
<p><i>Troublesome Ants:</i>&mdash;A heavy chalk mark laid a
finger's distance from your sugar box and all around (there must be
no space not covered) will surely prevent ants from troubling.</p>
<p><i>To Make Tough Meat Tender:</i>&mdash;Lay it a few minutes in
a strong vinegar water.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Discoloration from Bruises:</i>&mdash;Apply a cloth
wrung out in very hot water, and renew frequently until the pain
ceases. Or apply raw beefsteak.</p>
<p><i>A Good Polish for Removing Stains, Spots and Mildew from
Furniture</i> is made as follows: Take half a pint of ninety-eight
per cent, alcohol, a quarter of an ounce each of pulverized resin
and gum shellac, add half a pint of linseed oil; shake well and
apply with a brush or sponge.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Finger-Marks:</i>&mdash;Sweet oil will remove
finger-marks from varnished furniture, and kerosene from oiled
furniture.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Paint from Black Silk:</i>&mdash;Patient rubbing
with chloroform will remove paint from black silk or any other
goods, and will not hurt the most delicate color or fabric.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 569]</span><a name='Page_569' id=
"Page_569"></a>
<p><i>To Freshen Gilt Frames:</i>&mdash;Gilt frames may be revived
by carefully dusting them, and then washing with one ounce of soda
beaten up with the whites of three eggs. Scraped patches might be
touched tip with any gold paint. Castile soap and water, with
proper care, may be used to clean oil paintings; other methods
should not be employed without some skill.</p>
<p><i>To Destroy Moths in Furniture:</i>&mdash;All the baking and
steaming are useless, as, although the moths may be killed, their
eggs are sure to hatch, and the upholstery to be well riddled. The
naphtha-bath process is effectual. A sofa, chair or lounge may be
immersed in the large vats used for the purpose, and all insect
life will be absolutely destroyed. No egg ever hatches after
passing through the naphtha-bath; all oil, dirt or grease
disappears, and not the slightest damage is done to the most costly
article. Sponging with naphtha will not answer. It is the immersion
for two hours or more in the specially prepared vats which is
effectual.</p>
<p><i>Slicing Pineapples:</i>&mdash;The knife used for peeling a
pineapple should not be used for slicing it, as the rind contains
an acid that is apt to cause a swollen mouth and sore lips. The
Cubans use salt as an antidote for the ill effects of the peel.</p>
<p><i>To Clean Iron Sinks:</i>&mdash;Rub them well with a cloth wet
with kerosene oil.</p>
<p><i>To Erase Discoloration on Stone China:</i>&mdash;Dishes and
cups that are used for baking custards, puddings, etc., that
require scouring, may be easily cleaned by rubbing with a damp
cloth dipped in whiting or "Sapolio," then washed as usual.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Ink, Wine or Fruit Stains:</i>&mdash;Saturate well
in tomato juice; it is also an excellent thing to remove stains
from the hands.</p>
<p><i>To Set Colors in Washable Goods:</i>&mdash;Soak them previous
to washing in a water in which is allowed a tablespoonful of
ox-gall to a gallon of water.</p>
<p><i>To Take out Paint:</i>&mdash;Equal parts of ammonia and
turpentine will take paint out of clothing, no matter how dry or
hard it may be. Saturate the spot two or three times, then wash out
in soap-suds. Ten cents' worth of oxalic acid dissolved in a pint
of hot water will remove paint spots from the windows. Pour a
little into a cup, and apply to <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
570]</span><a name='Page_570' id="Page_570"></a>the spots with a
swab, but be sure not to allow the acid to touch the hands. Brasses
may be quickly cleaned with it. Great care must be exercised in
labeling the bottle, and putting it out of the reach of children,
as it is a deadly poison.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Tar from Cloth:</i>&mdash;Saturate the spot and rub
it well with turpentine, and every trace of tar will be
removed.</p>
<p><i>To Destroy Ants:</i>&mdash;Ants that frequent houses or
gardens may be destroyed by taking flour of brimstone half a pound,
and potash four ounces; set them in an iron or earthen pan over the
fire until dissolved and united; afterwards beat them to a powder,
and infuse a little of this powder in water, and wherever you
sprinkle it the ants will fly the place.</p>
<p><i>Simple Disinfectant:</i>&mdash;The following is a refreshing
disinfectant for a sick room, or any room that has an unpleasant
aroma prevading it: Put some fresh ground coffee in a saucer, and
in the centre place a small piece of camphor gum, which light with
a match. As the gum burns, allow sufficient coffee to consume with
it. The perfume is very pleasant and healthful, being far superior
to pastiles, and very much cheaper.</p>
<p><i>Cure for Hiccough:</i>&mdash;Sit erect and inflate the lungs
fully. Then, retaining the breath, bend forward slowly until the
chest meets the knees. After slowly arising again to the erect
position, slowly exhale the breath. Repeat this process a second
time, and the nerves will be found to have received an access of
energy that will enable them to perform their natural
functions.</p>
<p><i>To Keep out Mosquitoes and Bats:</i>&mdash;If a bottle of the
oil of pennyroyal is left uncorked in a room at night, not a
mosquito, nor any other blood-sucker, will be found there in the
morning. Mix potash with powdered meal, and throw it into the
rat-holes of a cellar, and the rats will depart. If a rat or a
mouse get into your pantry, stuff into its hole a rag saturated
with a solution of cayenne pepper, and no rat or mouse will touch
the rag for the purpose of opening communication with a depot of
supplies.</p>
<p><i>Salt will Curdle New Milk</i>; hence, in preparing porridge,
gravies, etc., the salt should not be added until the dish is
prepared.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Rust on Flat-Irons:</i>&mdash;Beeswax and salt
will make your rusty flat-irons as smooth and clean as glass. Tie a
lump of wax in <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 571]</span><a name=
'Page_571' id="Page_571"></a>a rag and keep it for that purpose.
When the irons are hot, rub them first with the wax rag, then scour
with a paper or cloth sprinkled with salt.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Rust on Knives:</i>&mdash;Steel knives which are
not in general use may be kept from rusting if they are dipped in a
strong solution of soda: one part water to four of soda; then wipe
dry, roll in flannel and keep in a dry place.</p>
<p><i>Flowers May be Kept Very Fresh over Night</i> if they are
excluded from the air. To do this, wet them thoroughly, put in a
damp box, and cover with wet raw cotton or wet newspaper, then
place in a cool spot.</p>
<p><i>To Sweeten Milk:</i>&mdash;Milk which is slightly turned or
changed may be sweetened and rendered fit for use again by stirring
in a little soda.</p>
<p><i>To Scour Knives Easily:</i>&mdash;Mix a small quantity of
baking soda with your brick-dust and see if your knives do not
polish better.</p>
<p><i>To Soften Boots and Shoes:</i>&mdash;Kerosene will soften
boots and shoes which have been hardened by water, and render them
as pliable as new. Kerosine will make tin kettles as bright as new.
Saturate a woolen rag and rub with it. It will also remove stains
from clean varnished furniture.</p>
<p><i>Faded Goods:</i>&mdash;Plush goods and all articles dyed with
aniline colors, which have faded from exposure to the light, will
look as bright as new after sponging with chloroform.</p>
<p><i>Choking:</i>&mdash;A piece of food lodged in the throat may
sometimes be pushed down with the finger, or removed with a
hair-pin quickly straightened and hooked at the end, or by two or
three vigorous blows on the back between the shoulders.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Mold on the Top of Glasses of Jelly</i>, lay a
lump of paraffine on the top of the hot jelly, letting it melt and
spread over it. No brandy paper and no other covering is necessary.
If preferred the paraffine can be melted and poured over after the
jelly is cold.</p>
<p><i>To Preserve Ribbons and Silks:</i>&mdash;Ribbons and silks
should be put away for preservation in brown paper; the chloride of
lime in white paper discolors them. A white satin dress should be
pinned up in blue paper with brown paper outside sewn together at
the edges.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 572]</span><a name='Page_572' id=
"Page_572"></a>
<p><i>To Preserve Bouquets:</i>&mdash;Put a little saltpetre in the
water you use for your bouquets and the flowers will live for a
fortnight.</p>
<p><i>To Destroy Cockroaches:</i>&mdash;Hellebore sprinkled on the
floor at night. They eat it and are poisoned.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Iron Rust:</i>&mdash;Lemon juice and salt will
remove ordinary iron rust. If the hands are stained there is
nothing that will remove the stains as well as lemon. Cut a lemon
in halves and apply the cut surface as if it were soap.</p>
<p><i>To Keep Bar Soap:</i>&mdash;Cut it into pieces and put it
into a dry place; it is more economical to use after it has become
hard, as it does not waste so readily.</p>
<p><i>To Brighten Carpets:</i>&mdash;Carpets after the dust has
been beaten out may be brightened by scattering upon them corn meal
mixed with salt and then sweeping it off. Mix salt and meal in
equal proportions. Carpets should be thoroughly beaten on the wrong
side first and then on the right side, after which spots may be
removed by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and water.</p>
<p><i>Silver Tea and Coffeepot:</i>&mdash;When putting away those
not in use every day lay a little stick across the top under the
cover. This will allow fresh air to get in and prevent the
mustiness of the contents, familiar to hotel and boarding-house
sufferers.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Creaking of Bedsteads:</i>&mdash;If a bedstead
creaks at each movement of the sleeper, remove the slats, and wrap
the ends of each in old newspapers.</p>
<p><i>To Clean Unvarnished Black Walnut:</i>&mdash;Milk, sour or
sweet, well rubbed in with an old soft flannel, will make black
walnut look new.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Cracking of Bottles and Fruit Jars:</i>&mdash;If a
bottle or fruit-jar that has been more than once used is placed on
a towel thoroughly soaked in hot water, there is little danger of
its being cracked by the introduction of a hot liquid.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent Lamp-wicks from Smoking:</i>&mdash;Soak them in
vinegar and then dry them thoroughly.</p>
<p>Rub the nickel stove-trimmings and the plated handles and hinges
of doors with kerosene and whiting, and polish with a dry
cloth.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 573]</span><a name='Page_573' id=
"Page_573"></a>
<p><i>Death to Bugs:</i>&mdash;Varnish is death to the most
persistent bug. It is cheap&mdash;ten cents' worth will do for one
bedstead&mdash;is easily used, is safe, and improves the looks of
the furniture to which it is applied. The application, must,
however, be thorough, the slats, sides, and every crack and corner
receiving attention.</p>
<p>That salt should be eaten with nuts to aid digestion.</p>
<p>That milk which stands too long makes bitter butter.</p>
<p><i>To Clean Drain Pipes:</i>&mdash;Drain pipes, and all places
that are sour or impure, may be cleaned with lime-water or carbolic
acid.</p>
<p>If oil-cloth be occasionally rubbed with a mixture of beeswax
and turpentine, it will last longer.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Mildew from Cloth:</i>&mdash;Put a teaspoonful of
chloride of lime into a quart of water, strain it twice, then dip
the mildewed places in this weak solution; lay in the sun; if the
mildew has not disappeared when dry, repeat the operation. Also
soaking the article in sour milk and salt; then lay in the sun;
repeat until all the mildew is out.</p>
<p><i>To Take Ink out of Linen:</i>&mdash;Dip the ink spot in pure
melted tallow, then wash out the tallow and the ink will come out
with it. This is said to be unfailing. Milk will remove ink from
linen or colored muslins, when acids would be ruinous, by soaking
the goods until the spot is very faint and then rubbing and rinsing
in cold water.</p>
<p>Ink spots on floors can be extracted by scouring with sand wet
in oil of vitriol and water. When ink is removed, rinse with strong
pearl-ash water.</p>
<p><i>To Toughen Lamp Chimneys and Glass-ware:</i>&mdash;Immerse
the article in a pot filled with cold water, to which some common
salt has been added. Boil the water well, then cool slowly. Glass
treated in this way will resist any sudden change of
temperature.</p>
<p><i>To Remove Paint from Window-glass:</i>&mdash;Rub it well with
hot sharp vinegar.</p>
<p><i>To Clean Stove-pipe:</i>&mdash;A piece of zinc put on the
live coals in the stove will clean out the stove-pipe.</p>
<p><i>Packing Bottles:</i>&mdash;India-rubber bands slipped over
them will prevent breakage.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 574]</span><a name='Page_574' id=
"Page_574"></a>
<p><i>To Clean Ivory Ornaments:</i>&mdash;When ivory ornaments
become yellow or dusky, wash them well in soap and water with a
small brush, to clean the carvings, and then place them, while wet,
in the sunshine. Wet them with soapy water for two or three days,
several times a day, still keeping them in the sunshine, then wash
them again, and they will be perfectly white.</p>
<p><i>Stained Brass:</i>&mdash;Whiting wet with aqua ammonia, will
cleanse brass from stains, and is excellent for polishing faucets
and door-knobs of brass or silver. "Sapolio" is still better.</p>
<p><i>Hartshorn</i> applied to the stings of poisonous insects will
allay the pain and stop the swelling; or apply oil of sassafras,
which is better. Bee stings should be treated in this way.</p>
<p><i>For Cleaning Glass Bottles:</i>&mdash;Crush egg-shells into
small bits, or a few carpet tacks, or a small quantity of gunshot,
put into the bottle; then fill one-half full of strong soap-suds;
shake thoroughly, then rinse in clear water. Will look like
new.</p>
<p><i>Cutting off Glass Bottles for Clips and Jars:</i>&mdash;A
simple, practical way is to take a red-hot poker with a pointed
end; make a mark with a file to begin the cut; then apply the hot
iron and a crack will start, which will follow the iron wherever it
is carried. This is, on the whole, simple, and better than the use
of strings wet with turpentine, etc.</p>
<p><i>Cistern Water may be Purified</i> by charcoal put in a bag
and hung in the water.</p>
<p><i>Salt will Remove the Stain from Silver</i> caused by eggs,
when applied dry with a soft cloth.</p>
<p><i>Opened Fruit, Fish or Vegetables:</i>&mdash;Never allow
opened fruit, fish or vegetables to stand in the tin can. Never
stir anything in tin, or, if it is done, use a wooden spoon. In
lifting pies or cakes from bright tin pans, use great caution that
the knife does not scrape off flecks of bright metal.</p>
<p>Never use water which has stood in a lead pipe over night.
<i>Not less than a wooden bucketful should be allowed to
run.</i></p>
<p>Never use water from a stone reservoir for cooking purposes.</p>
<p>Never allow fresh meat to remain in paper; it absorbs the
juices.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 575]</span><a name='Page_575' id=
"Page_575"></a>
<p>Never keep vinegar or yeast in stone crocks or jugs; their acid
attacks the glazing, which is said to be poisonous. Glass for
either is better.</p>
<p><i>Squeaking Doors</i> ought to have the hinges oiled by putting
on a drop from the sewing machine oil-can.</p>
<p><i>Plate Glass and Mirrors:</i>&mdash;A soft cloth wet in
alcohol, is excellent to wipe off plate glass and mirrors, and
prevents their becoming frosty in winter.</p>
<p>A red-hot iron will soften old putty so that it can be easily
removed.</p>
<p><i>To Test Nutmegs:</i>&mdash;Prick them with a pin; if good,
the oil will instantly spread around the puncture.</p>
<p><i>A Good Way to Clean Mica</i> in a stove that has become
blackened with smoke, is to take it out, and thoroughly wash it
with vinegar. If the black does not come off at once, let it soak a
little.</p>
<p><i>To Banish Rats from the Premises</i>, use pounded glass mixed
with dry corn meal, placed within their reach. Sprinkling cayenne
pepper in their holes will also banish them. Chloride of lime is an
infallible remedy, spread around where they come, and thrown into
their holes; it should be renewed once in two weeks. Tar is also a
good remedy.</p>
<p><i>To Prevent the Odor of Boiling Ham or
Cabbage:</i>&mdash;Throw red pepper pods or a few bits of charcoal
into the pan they are cooking in.</p>
<p><i>To Brighten Gilt Frames:</i>&mdash;Take sufficient flour of
sulphur to give a golden tinge to about one and one-half pints of
water, and in this boil four or five bruised onions, or garlic,
which will answer the same purpose. Strain off the liquid, and with
it, when cold, wash with a soft brush any gilding which requires
restoring, and when dry, it will come out as bright as new
work.</p>
<p>All cooking utensils, including iron-ware, should be washed
outside and inside in hot, soapy water; rinsed in clean, hot water,
wiped dry with a dry towel; a soapy or greasy dish-cloth should
never be used for the purpose.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 576]</span><a name='Page_576' id=
"Page_576"></a>
<p>A cake of sapolio should be kept in every kitchen, to be used
freely on all dishes that require scouring and cleansing. All tins
that have become discolored can be made as bright and clean as new
by the use of sapolio; also shines dishes; and, in fact, almost all
articles that require any scouring. Purchased at all groceries. One
of the most useful articles ever used in the kitchen.</p>

growth of the hair ever known.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 579]</span><a name='Page_579' id=
"Page_579"></a>
<p><i>Another:</i>&mdash;To a pint of strong sage tea, a pint of
bay rum and a quarter of an ounce of the tincture of cantharides,
add an ounce of castor oil and a teaspoonful of rose, or other
perfume. Shake well before applying to the hair, as the oil will
not mix.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PHALON'S INSTANTANEOUS HAIR DYE.</b></p>
<p>To one ounce of crystallized nitrate of silver, dissolved in one
ounce of concentrated aqua ammonia, add one ounce of gum arabic and
six ounces of soft water. Keep in the dark. Remember to remove all
grease from the hair before applying the dye.</p>
<p>There is danger in some of the patent hair dyes, and hence the
<i>Scientific American</i> offers what is known as the walnut hair
dye. The simplest form is the expressed juice of the bark or shell
of green walnuts. To preserve the juice a little alcohol is
commonly added to it with a few bruised cloves, and the whole
digested together, with occasional agitation, for a week or
fortnight, when the clear portion is decanted, and, if necessary,
filtered. Sometimes a little common salt is added with the same
intention. It should be kept in a cool place. The most convenient
way of application is by means of a sponge.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DYE FOR WHITE OR LIGHT EYEBROWS.</b></p>
<p>Boil an ounce of walnut bark in a pint of water for an hour. Add
a lump of alum the size of a filbert, and when cold, apply with a
camel's-hair brush.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HAIR WASH.</b></p>
<p>One penny's worth of borax, half a pint of olive oil, one pint
of boiling water.</p>
<p>Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil; let it cool; then
put the mixture into a bottle. Shake it before using, and apply it
with a flannel. Camphor and borax, dissolved in boiling water and
left to cool, make a very good wash for the hair; as also does
rosemary water mixed with a little borax. After using any of these
washes, when the hair becomes thoroughly dry, a little pomatum or
oil should be rubbed in to make it smooth and glossy&mdash;that is,
if one prefers oil on the hair.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OXMARROW-POMADE FOR THE HAIR.</b></p>
<p>One marrow bone, half a pint of oil, ten cents' worth of
citronella. Take the marrow out of the bone, place it in warm
water, let it get almost to boiling point, then let it cool and
pour the water away; repeat <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
580]</span><a name='Page_580' id="Page_580"></a>this three times
until the marrow is thoroughly "fined." Beat the marrow to a cream
with a silver fork, stir the oil in, drop by drop, beating all the
time; when quite cold add the citronella, pour into jars and cover
down.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO INCREASE THE HAIR IN THE BROWS.</b></p>
<p>Clip them and anoint with a, little sweet oil. Should the hair
fall out, having been full, use one of the hair invigorators.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BANDOLINE.</b></p>
<p>To one quart of rose-water add an ounce and a half of gum
tragacanth; let it stand forty-eight hours, frequently straining
it, then strain through a coarse linen cloth; let it stand two
days, and again strain; add to it a drachm of oil of roses. Used by
ladies dressing their hair, to make it lie in any position.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COMPLEXION WASH.</b></p>
<p>Put in a vial one drachm of benzoin gum in powder, one drachm
nutmeg oil, six drops of orange-blossom tea, or apple blossoms put
in half pint of rain-water and boiled down to one teaspoonful and
strained, one pint of sherry wine. Bathe the face morning and
night; will remove all flesh-worms and freckles, and give a
beautiful complexion. Or, put one ounce of powdered gum of benzoin
in a pint of whisky; to use, put in water in wash-bowl till it is
milky, allowing it to dry without wiping. This is perfectly
harmless.</p>
<p>Cream cures sun-burn on some complexions, lemon juice is best on
others, and cold water suits still others best.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BURNET'S CELEBRATED POWDER FOR THE FACE.</b></p>
<p>Five cents' worth of bay rum, five cents' worth of magnesia
snowflake, five cents' worth of bergamot, five cents' worth of oil
of lemon; mix in a pint bottle and fill up with rain-water. Shake
well, and apply with a soft sponge or cloth.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOILET OR FACE POWDER.</b></p>
<p>Take a quarter of a pound of wheat starch pounded fine; sift it
through a fine sieve, or a piece of lace; add to it eight drops of
oil of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 581]</span><a name='Page_581' id=
"Page_581"></a>rose, oil of lemon thirty drops, oil of bergamot
fifteen drops. Rub thoroughly together.</p>
<p>The French throw this powder into alcohol, shaking it, letting
it settle, then pouring off the alcohol and drying the powder. In
that case, the perfume is added lastly.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO REMOVE FRECKLES.</b></p>
<p>The following lotion is highly recommended: One ounce of lemon
juice, a quarter of a drachm of powdered borax, and half a drachm
of sugar; mix in a bottle, and allow them to stand a few days, when
the liquor should be rubbed occasionally on the hands and face.
Another application is: Friar's balsam one part, rose-water twenty
parts.</p>
<p>Powdered nitre moistened with water and applied to the face
night and morning, is said to remove freckles without injury to the
skin.</p>
<p>Also, a tablespoonful of freshly grated horse-radish, stirred
into a cupful of sour milk; let it stand for twelve hours, then
strain and apply often. This bleaches the complexion also, and
takes off tan.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TO REMOVE MOTH PATCHES.</b></p>
<p>Into a pint of rum put a tablespoonful of flour of sulphur.
Apply this to the patches once a day, and they will disappear in
two or three weeks.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CURE FOR PIMPLES.</b></p>
<p>One teaspoonful of carbolic acid and one pint of rose-water
mixed is an excellent remedy for pimples. Bathe the skin thoroughly
and often, but do not let the wash get into the eyes.</p>
<p>This wash is soothing to mosquito bites, and irritations of the
skin of every nature.</p>
<p>It is advisable, in order to clear the complexion permanently,
to cleanse the blood; then the wash would be of advantage.</p>
<p>To obtain a good complexion, a person's diet should receive the
first attention. Greasy food, highly spiced soups, hot bread and
butter, meats or game, rich gravies, alcoholic liquors,
coffee&mdash;all are injurious to the complexion. Strong tea used
daily will after a time give the skin the color and appearance of
leather. Coffee affects the nerves more, but the skin less, and a
healthy nervous system is necessary to beauty. Eating between
meals, late suppers, over-eating at <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
582]</span><a name='Page_582' id="Page_582"></a>meals, eating
sweetmeats, candies, etc., all these tend to disorder the blood,
producing pimples and blotches.</p>
<p>Washing of the face or skin is another consideration for a good
complexion; it should be thoroughly washed in plenty of luke-warm
water with some mild soap&mdash;then rinsed in clear water
<i>well</i>; dry with a thick soft towel. If suds is left or wiped
off the skin, the action of the air and sun will tan the surface,
and permanently deface the complexion; therefore one should be sure
to thoroughly rinse off all soap from the skin to avoid the
tanning, which will leave a brown or yellow tinge impossible to
efface.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEARL SMELLING SALTS.</b></p>
<p>Powdered carbonate of ammonia one ounce, strong solution of
ammonia half a fluid ounce, oil of rosemary ten drops, oil of
bergamot ten drops. Mix, and while moist put in wide-mouthed bottle
which is to be well closed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEARL TOOTH POWDER.</b></p>
<p>Prepared chalk half a pound, powdered myrrh two ounces; camphor
two drachms, orris root, powdered, two ounces; moisten the camphor
with alcohol and mix well together.</p>
<br>
<p><b>REMOVING TARTAR FROM THE TEETH.</b></p>
<p>This preparation is used by dentists. Pure muriatic acid one
ounce, water one ounce, honey two ounces, mix thoroughly. Take a
tooth-brush, and wet it freely with this preparation, and briskly
rub the black teeth, and in a moment's time they will be perfectly
white; then immediately wash out the mouth well with water, that
the acid may not act on the enamel of the teeth. This should be
done only occasionally.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAD BREATH.</b></p>
<p>Bad breath from catarrh, foul stomach, or bad teeth, may be
temporarily relieved by diluting a little bromo chloralum with
eight or ten parts of water, and using it as a gargle, and
swallowing a few drops before going out. A pint of bromo chloralum
costs fifty cents, but a small vial will last a long time.</p>
<br>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 583]</span><a name='Page_583' id=
"Page_583"></a>
<p><b>SHAVING COMPOUND.</b></p>
<p>Half a pound of plain, white soap, dissolved in a small quantity
of alcohol, as little as can be used; add a tablespoonful of
pulverized borax. Shave the soap and put it in a small tin basin or
cup; place it on the fire in a dish of boiling water; when melted,
add the alcohol, and remove from the fire; stir in oil of bergamot
sufficient to perfume it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BARBER'S SHAMPOO MIXTURE.</b></p>
<p>Dissolve half an ounce of carbonate of ammonia and one ounce of
borax in one quart of water; then add two ounces of glycerine in
three quarts of New England rum, and one quart of bay rum. Moisten
the hair with this liquid; shampoo with the hands until a light
lather is formed; then wash off with plenty of clean water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RAZOR-STROP PASTE.</b></p>
<p>Wet the strop with a little sweet oil, and apply a little flour
of emery evenly over the surface.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CAMPHOR ICE.</b></p>
<p>Melt together over a water bath white wax and spermaceti each
one ounce, camphor two ounces, sweet almond oil, one pound, then
triturate until the mixture has become homogeneous, and allow one
pound of rose-water to flow in slowly during the operation.
Excellent for chapped lips or hands.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ODORIFEROUS OR SWEET-SCENTING BAGS.</b></p>
<p>Lavender flowers one ounce, pulverized orris, two drachms,
bruised rosemary leaves half ounce, musk five grains, attar of rose
five drops. Mix well, sew up in small flat muslin bags, and cover
them with fancy silk or satin.</p>
<p>These are very nice to keep in your bureau drawers or trunk, as
the perfume penetrates through the contents of the trunk or
drawers. An acceptable present to a single gentleman.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO KEEP BRUSHES CLEAN.</b></p>
<p>The best way in which to clean hair-brushes is with spirits of
ammonia, as its effect is immediate. No rubbing is required, and
cold <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 584]</span><a name='Page_584' id=
"Page_584"></a>water can be used just as successfully as warm. Take
a tablespoonful of ammonia to a quart of water, dip the hair part
of the brush without wetting the ivory, and in a moment the grease
is removed; then rinse in cold water, shake well, and dry in the
air, but not in the sun. Soda and soap soften the bristles and
invariably turn the ivory yellow.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOILET ITEMS.</b></p>
<p>Mutton tallow is considered excellent to soften the hands. It
may be rubbed on at any time when the hands are perfectly dry, but
the best time is when retiring, and an old pair of soft, large
gloves thoroughly covered on the inside with the tallow and
glycerine in equal parts, melted together, can be worn during the
night with the most satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Four parts of glycerine and five parts of yolks of eggs
thoroughly mixed, and applied after washing the hands, is also
considered excellent.</p>
<p>For chapped hands or face: One ounce of glycerine, one ounce of
alcohol mixed, then add eight ounces of rose-water.</p>
<p>Another good rule is to rub well in dry oatmeal after every
washing, and be particular regarding the quality of soap. Cheap
soap and hard water are the unknown enemies of many people, and the
cause of rough skin and chapped hands. Castile soap and rain-water
will sometimes cure without any other assistance.</p>
<p>Camphor ice is also excellent, and can be applied with but
little inconvenience. Borax dissolved and added to the toilet water
is also good.</p>
<p>For chapped lips, beeswax dissolved in a small quantity of sweet
oil, by heating carefully. Apply the salve two or three times a
day, and avoid wetting the lips as much as possible.</p>
<p>To soften the hands: One can have the hands in soap-suds with
soft soap without injury to the skin if the hands are dipped in
vinegar or lemon juice immediately after. The acids destroy the
corrosive effects of the alkali, and make the hands soft and white.
Indian meal and vinegar or lemon juice used on hands where
roughened by cold or labor will heal and soften them. Rub the hands
in this, then wash off thoroughly and rub in glycerine. Those who
suffer from chapped hands will find this comforting.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 585]</span><a name='Page_585' id=
"Page_585"></a>
<p>To remove stains, rub a slice of raw potato upon the stains; or
wash the hands in lemon juice or steeped laurel-leaves.</p>
<p>To give a fine color to the nails, the hands and fingers must be
well lathered and washed with fine soap; then the nails must be
rubbed with equal parts of cinnebar and emery, followed by oil of
bitter almonds. To take white spots from the nails, melt equal
parts of pitch and turpentine in a small cup; add to it vinegar and
powdered sulphur. Rub this on the nails and the spots will soon
disappear.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOILET SOAP.</b></p>
<p>One pound of washing soda, one pound of lard or clear tallow,
half a pound of unslaked lime, one tablespoonful of salt, three
quarts of water. Put the soda and lime in a large dish, and pour
over the water, boiling hot; stir until dissolved; let it stand
until clear, then pour off the clear liquid, add the grease and
salt; boil four hours, then pour into pans to cool. If it should be
inclined to curdle or separate, indicating the lime to be too
strong, pour in a little more water, and boil again. Perfume as you
please, and pour into molds or a shallow dish, and, when cold, cut
into bars to dry.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS.</b></p>
<p>The following list gives some of the more common poisons and the
remedies most likely to be on hand in case of need:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Acids:</i>&mdash;These cause great heat and sensation of
burning pain from the mouth down to the stomach. The remedies are-:
Magnesia, soda, pearl ash, or soap dissolved in water, every two

the white of an egg in half a cupful of milk or lime water. Chalk
and water is good, and the preparation of iron, ten drops in water
every half hour: hydrated magnesia.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 586]</span><a name='Page_586' id=
"Page_586"></a>

stimulate the nostrils and lungs with hartshorn, at the same time
rubbing the chest briskly.</p>
<p><i>Corrosive Sublimate, Saltpetre, Blue Vitriol, Bed-bug
Poison:</i>&mdash;Give white of egg, freshly mixed with water, in
large quantities; or give wheat flour and water, or soap and water
freely, or salt and water, or large draughts of milk.</p>
<p><i>Lead:</i>&mdash;White lead and sugar of lead. Give an emetic,
then follow with cathartics, such as castor oil, and epsom salts
especially.</p>
<p><i>Nux Vomica:</i>&mdash;First emetics, and then brandy.</p>
<p><i>Oxalic Acid (frequently taken for epsom
salts):</i>&mdash;First give soap and water, or chalk or magnesia
and water. Give every two minutes.</p>
<p><i>White Vitriol:</i>&mdash;Give plenty of milk and water.</p>
<p><i>Tartar Emetic:</i>&mdash;Take large doses of tea made of
white oak bark, or peruvian bark. Drink plenty of warm water to
encourage vomiting; then, if the vomiting should not stop, give a
grain of opium in water.</p>
<p><i>Nitrate of Silver (lunar caustic):</i>&mdash;Give a strong
solution of common salt and water, and then an emetic.</p>
<p><i>Verdigris:</i>&mdash;Give plenty of white of egg and
water.</p>
<p><i>Tobacco:</i>&mdash;Emetics, frequent draughts of cold water;

<p>An ingenious housewife will manage to do with less conveniences,
but these articles, if they can be purchased in the commencement of
housekeeping, will save time and labor, making the preparation of
food more easy&mdash;and it is always economy in the end to get the
best material in all wares, as, for instance, the double plate tin
will last for years, whereas the poor kind has to be replaced in a
short time; the low-priced earthenware is soon broken up, whereas
the strong stoneware, costing but a trifle more, lasts almost a
lifetime.</p>
<p>In relation to the economy and management of the kitchen, I
might suggest that the most essential thing is cleanliness in
cooking, and also cleanliness with your person as well as in the
keeping of the kitchen.</p>
<p>The hands of the cook should be always thoroughly cleansed
before touching or handling anything pertaining to the cooking.
Next there should never be anything wasted or thrown away that can
be turned to account, either for your own family or some family in
poor circumstances. Bread that has become hard can be used for
toasting, or for stuffing and pudding. In warm weather any gravies
or soups that are left from the preceding day should be boiled up
and poured into clean pans. This is particularly necessary where
vegetables have been added to the preparation, as it then so soon
turns sour. In cooler weather, every other day will be often enough
to warm up these things. In cooking, clear as you go; that is to
say, do not allow a host of basins, plates, spoons, and other
utensils, to accumulate on the dressers and tables whilst you are
engaged in preparing the dinner. By a little management and
forethought, much confusion may be saved in this way. It is as easy
to put a thing in its place when it is done with, as it is to keep
continually moving it to find room for fresh requisites. For
instance, after making a pudding, the flour-tub, paste-board, and
rolling-pin, should be put away, and any basins, spoons, etc.,
should be neatly packed up near the sink, to be washed when the
proper time arrives. Neatness, order and method should be always
observed.</p>
<p>Never let your stock of spices, salt, seasoning, herbs, etc.,
dwindle down so low that some day, in the midst of preparing a
large dinner, you find yourself minus a very important ingredient,
thereby causing much confusion and annoyance.</p>
<p>After you have washed your saucepans, fish-kettle, etc., stand
them before the fire for a few minutes to get thoroughly dry
inside, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 591]</span><a name='Page_591' id=
"Page_591"></a>before putting them away. They should then be kept
in a dry place, in order that they may escape the deteriorating
influence of rust, and thereby be quickly destroyed. Never leave
saucepans dirty from one day's use to be cleaned the next; it is
slovenly and untidy.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of hot water in washing up dishes and dirty
cooking utensils. As these are essentially greasy, luke-warm water
cannot possibly have the effect of cleansing them effectually. Do
not be chary also of changing and renewing the water occasionally.
You will thus save yourself much time and labor in the long
run.</p>
<p>Keep a cake of sapolio always on hand in the
kitchen&mdash;always convenient for rubbing off stains from
earthenware, tin, glass, in fact, almost everything but silver; it
is a cheap and valuable article, and can be purchased at nearly
every grocery in the United States.</p>

<h2><b>DYEING OR COLORING.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>GENERAL REMARKS.</b></p>
<p>Everything should be clean. The goods should be scoured in soap
and the soap rinsed out. They are often steeped in soap lye over
night. Dip them into water just before putting them into
preparations, to prevent spotting. Soft water should be used,
<i>sufficient to cover the goods well; this is always understood
where quantity is not mentioned</i>. When goods are dyed, air them;
then rinse well, and hang up to dry. Do not wring silk or merino
dresses when scouring or dyeing them. If cotton goods are to be
dyed a light color, they should first be bleached.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SILKS.</b></p>
<p><i>Black:</i>&mdash;Make a weak lye as for black or woolens;
work goods in bichromate of potash a little below boiling heat,
then dip in the log-wood in the same way; if colored in blue
vitriol dye, use about the same heat.</p>
<p><i>Orange:</i>&mdash;For one pound goods, annotto one pound,
soda one pound; repeat as desired.</p>
<p><i>Green&mdash;Very Handsome:</i>&mdash;For one pound goods,
yellow oak bark eight ounces; boil one-half hour; turn off the
liquor from bark and add alum six ounces; let it stand until cold;
while making this, color <span class='pagenum'>[Pg
592]</span><a name='Page_592' id="Page_592"></a>goods in blue
dye-tub a light blue, dry and wash, dip in alum and bark dye. If it
does not take well, warm the dye a little.</p>
<p><i>Purple:</i>&mdash;For one pound goods. First obtain a light
blue, by dipping in home-made dye-tub; then dry; dip in alum four
ounces, with water to cover, when little warm. If color is not full
enough add chemic.</p>
<p><i>Yellow:</i>&mdash;For one pound goods, alum three ounces,
sugar of lead three-fourths ounce; immerse goods in solution over
night; take out, drain, and make a new lye with fustic one pound;
dip until the required color is obtained.</p>
<p><i>Crimson:</i>&mdash;For one pound goods, alum three ounces;
dip at hand heat one hour; take out and drain while making new dye
by boiling ten minutes, cochineal three ounces, bruised nutgalls
two ounces and cream of tartar one-fourth ounce, in one pail of
water; when little cool, begin to dip, raising heat to boil; dip
one hour; wash and dry.</p>
<p><i>Sky Blue on Silk or Cotton&mdash;Very
Beautiful:</i>&mdash;Give goods as much color from a solution of
blue vitriol two ounces, to water one gallon, as it will take up in
dipping fifteen minutes; then run it through lime water. This will
make a beautiful and durable sky blue.</p>
<p><i>Brown on Silk or Cotton&mdash;Very Beautiful:</i>&mdash;After
obtaining a blue color as above, run goods through a solution of
prussiate of potash one ounce, to water one gallon.</p>
<p><i>Light Blue:</i>&mdash;For cold water one gallon, dissolve
alum one-half tablespoonful, in hot water one teacupful, and add to
it; then add chemic, one teaspoonful at a time to obtain the
desired color&mdash;the more chemic the darker the color.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WOOLEN GOODS.</b></p>
<p><i>Chrome Black&mdash;Best in Use:</i>&mdash;For five pounds of
goods, blue vitriol six ounces; boil a few minutes, then dip the
goods three-fourths of an hour, airing often; take out the goods,
make a dye with three pounds of log-wood, boil one-half hour; dip
three-fourths of an hour, air goods, and dip three-fourths of an
hour more. Wash in strong suds. This will not fade by exposure to
sun.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 593]</span><a name='Page_593' id=
"Page_593"></a>
<p><i>Wine Color:</i>&mdash;For five pounds of goods, camwood two
pounds; boil fifteen minutes and dip the goods one-half hour; boil
again and dip one-half hour then darken with blue vitriol one and
one-half ounces; if not dark enough, add copperas one-half
ounce.</p>
<p><i>Scarlet&mdash;Very Fine:</i>&mdash;For one pound of goods,
cream of tartar one-half ounce, cochineal, well pulverized, one
half ounce, muriate of tin two and one-half ounces; boil up the dye
and enter the goods; work them briskly for ten or fifteen minutes,
then boil one and one-half hours, stirring goods slowly while
boiling. Wash in clear water and dry in the shade.</p>
<p><i>Pink:</i>&mdash;For three pounds of goods, alum three ounces;
boil and dip the goods one hour, then add to the dye, cream of
tartar four ounces, cochineal, well pulverized, one ounce; boil
well and dip the goods while boiling until the color suits.</p>
<p><i>Blue&mdash;Quick Process:</i>&mdash;For two pounds of goods,
alum five ounces, cream of tartar three ounces; boil goods in this
one hour, then put them into warm water which has more or less
extract of indigo in it, according to the depth of color desired,
and boil again until it suits, adding more of the blue if
needed.</p>
<p><i>Madder Red:</i>&mdash;To each pound of goods, alum five
ounces, red or cream of tartar one ounce. Put in the goods and
bring the kettle to a boil for one-half hour; then air them and
boil one-half hour longer; empty the kettle and fill with clean
water; put in bran one peck; make it milk-warm, and let it stand
until the bran rises; then skim off the bran and put in one-half
pound madder; put in the goods and heat slowly until it boils and
is done. Wash in strong suds.</p>
<p><i>Green:</i>&mdash;For each pound of goods, fustic one pound,
with alum three and one-half ounces; steep until strength is out,
and soak the goods therein until a good yellow is obtained, then
remove the chips, and add extract of indigo or chemic, one
tablespoonful at a time, until color suits.</p>
<p><i>Snuff Brown, Dark:</i>&mdash;For five pounds of goods,
camwood one pound; boil it fifteen minutes; then dip the goods
three-fourths of an hour; take them out and add to the dye two and
one-half pounds fustic; boil ten minutes, and dip the goods
three-fourths of an hour; then add blue vitriol one ounce, copperas
four ounces; dip again one-half hour. If not dark enough add more
copperas.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 594]</span><a name='Page_594' id=
"Page_594"></a>
<p><i>Another Method&mdash;Any Shade:</i>&mdash;Boil the goods in a
mordant of alum two parts, copperas three parts; then rinse them
through a bath of madder. The tint depends on the relative
proportions of the copperas and alum; the more copperas, the darker
the dye; joint weight of both should not be more than one-eighth of
weight of goods. Mixtures of reds and yellows with blues and
blacks, or simple dyes, will make any shade.</p>
<p><i>Orange:</i>&mdash;For five pounds of goods, muriate of tin
six tablespoonfuls, argol four ounces; boil and dip one hour and
add again to the dye one teacupful of madder; dip again one-half
hour. Cochineal, about two ounces, in place of madder, makes a much
brighter color.</p>
<p><i>Purple:</i>&mdash;For each pound of goods, two ounces of
cudbear; rinse the goods well in soap-suds, then dissolve cudbear
in hot suds&mdash;not quite boiling, and soak the goods until of
required color. The color is brightened by rinsing in alum
water.</p>
<p><i>Yellow&mdash;Rich:</i>&mdash;Work five pounds of goods
one-half hour in a boiling bath with three ounces bichromate of
potassa and two ounces alum; lift and expose till well cooled and
drained; then work one-half hour in another bath with five pounds
of fustic. Wash out and dry.</p>
<p><i>Crimson:</i>&mdash;Work for one hour in a bath with one pound
cochineal paste, six ounces of dry cochineal, one pound of tartar,
one pint of protochloride of tin. Wash out and dry.</p>
<p><i>Salmon:</i>&mdash;For each pound of goods, one-fourth pound
of annotto, one-fourth pound of soap; rinse the goods well in warm
water, put them into mixture and boil one-half hour. Shade will be
according to the amount of annotto.</p>
<p><i>Dove and Slate Colors of All Shades:</i>&mdash;Boil in an
iron vessel a teacupful of black tea with a teaspoonful of copperas
and sufficient water. Dilute till you get the shade wanted.</p>
<br>
<p><b>COTTON GOODS.</b></p>
<p><i>Black:</i>&mdash;For five pounds of goods, boil them in a
decoction of three pounds of sumach one-half hour and steep twelve
hours; dip in lime-water one-half hour; take out and let them drip
one hour, run them through the lime-water again fifteen minutes.
Make a new dye with two and one-half pounds log-wood (boiled one
hour) and dip <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 595]</span><a name=
'Page_595' id="Page_595"></a>again three hours; add bichromate
potash two ounces, to the log-wood dye and dip one hour. Wash in
clear, cold water and dry in the shade. Only process for permanent
black.</p>
<p><i>Sky Blue:</i>&mdash;For three pounds of goods, blue vitriol
four ounces; boil a few minutes, then dip the goods three hours;
then pass them through a strong lime-water. A <i>beautiful</i>
brown can be obtained by next putting the goods through a solution
of prussiate of potash.</p>
<p><i>Green:</i>&mdash;Dip the goods in home-made blue; dye until
blue enough is obtained to make the green as dark as required; take
out, dry and rinse a little. Make a dye with fustic three pounds,
of log-wood three ounces, to each pound of goods, by boiling dye
one hour; when cooled so as to bear the hand put in the goods, move
briskly a few minutes, and let lie one hour; take out and
thoroughly drain; dissolve and add to the dye for each pound of
cotton, blue vitriol one-half ounce, and dip another hour. Wring
out and let dry in the shade. By adding or diminishing the log-wood
and fustic any shade may be had.</p>
<p><i>Yellow:</i>&mdash;For five pounds of goods, seven ounces of
sugar of lead; dip the goods two hours; make a new dye with
bichromate of potash four ounces; dip until the color suits; wring
out and dry. If not yellow enough, repeat.</p>
<p><i>Orange:</i>&mdash;For five pounds of goods, sugar of lead
four ounces; boil a few minutes; when a little cool, put in the
goods; dip for two hours; wring out; make a new dye with bichromate
potash eight ounces, madder two ounces; dip until it suits; if
color is too red, take a small sample and dip into lime-water and
choose between them.</p>
<p><i>Red:</i>&mdash;Muriate of tin two-thirds of a teacupful; add
water to cover the goods; raise to boiling heat; put in the goods
one hour, stir often; take out, empty the kettle, put in clean
water with nic-wood one pound; steep one-half hour at hand heat;
then put in the goods and increase the heat one hour&mdash;not
boiling. Air the goods and dip them one hour as before. Wash
without soap.</p>

<a name='SMALL_POINTS_ON_TABLE_ETIQUETTE' id=
"SMALL_POINTS_ON_TABLE_ETIQUETTE"></a>
<h2><b>SMALL POINTS ON TABLE ETIQUETTE.</b></h2>
<br>
<p>Delicacy of manner at table stamps both man and woman, for one
can, at a glance, discern whether a person has been trained to eat
well&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to hold the knife and fork properly, to eat
without the slightest <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 596]</span><a name=
'Page_596' id="Page_596"></a>sound of the lips, to drink quietly,
to use the napkin rightly, to make no noise with any of the
implements of the table, and last, but not least, to eat slowly and
masticate the food thoroughly. All these points should be most
carefully taught to children, and then they will always feel at
their ease at the grandest tables in the land. There is no position
where the innate refinement of a person is more fully exhibited
than at the table, and nowhere that those who have not been trained
in table etiquette feel more keenly their deficiencies. The knife
should never be used to carry food to the mouth, but only to cut it
up into small mouthfuls; then place it upon the plate at one side,
and take the fork in the right hand, and eat all the food with it.
When both have been used finally, they should be laid diagonally
across the plate, with both handles toward the right hand; this is
understood by well-trained waiters to be the signal for removing
them, together with the plate.</p>
<p>Be careful to keep the mouth shut closely while masticating the
food. It is the opening of the lips which causes the smacking which
seems very disgusting. Chew your food well, but do it silently, and
be careful to take small mouthfuls. The knife can be used to cut
the meat finely, as large pieces of meat are not healthful, and
appear very indelicate. At many tables, two, three or more knives
and forks are placed on the table, the knives at the right hand of
the plate, the forks at the left,&mdash;a knife and a fork for each
course, so that there need be no replacing of them after the
breakfast and dinner is served. The smaller ones, which are for
game, dessert, or for hot cakes at breakfast, can be tucked under
the edges of the plate, and the large ones, for the meat and
vegetables, are placed outside of them. Be very careful not to
clatter your knives and forks upon your plates, but use them
without noise. When passing the plate for a second helping, lay
them together at one side of the plate, with handles to the right.
When you are helped to anything, <i>do not</i> wait until the rest
of the company are provided, as it is not considered good breeding.
Soup is always served for the first course, and it should be eaten
with dessert spoons, and taken from the sides, not the tips, of
them, without any sound of the lips, and not sucked into the mouth
audibly from the ends of the spoon. Bread should not be broken into
soup or gravy. Never ask to be helped to soup a second time. The
hostess may ask you to take a second plate, but you will politely
decline. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 597]</span><a name='Page_597'
id="Page_597"></a>Fish chowder, which is served in soup plates, is
said to be an exception which proves this rule, and when eating of
that it is correct to take a second plateful if desired.</p>
<p>Another generally neglected obligation is that of spreading
butter on one's bread as it lies in one's plate, or but slightly
lifted at one end of the plate; it is very frequently buttered in
the air, bitten in gouges, and still held in the face and eyes of
the table with the marks of the teeth on it; This is certainly not
altogether pleasant, and it is better to cut it, a bit at a time,
after buttering it, and put piece by piece in the mouth with one's
finger and thumb. Never help yourself to butter, or any other food
with your own knife or fork. It is not considered good taste to mix
food on the same plate. Salt must be left on the side of the plate
and never on the tablecloth.</p>
<p>Let us mention a few things concerning the eating of which there
is sometimes doubt. A cream-cake and anything of similar nature
should be eaten with knife and fork, never bitten.
Asparagus&mdash;which should be always served on bread or toast so
as to absorb superfluous moisture&mdash;may be taken from the
finger and thumb; if it is fit to be set before you the whole of it
may be eaten. Pastry should be broken and eaten with a fork, never
cut with a knife. Raw oysters should be eaten with a fork, also
fish. Peas and beans, as we all know, require the fork only;
however food that cannot be held with a fork should be eaten with a
spoon. Potatoes, if mashed, should be mashed with the fork. Green
corn should be eaten from the cob; but it must be held with a
single hand.</p>
<p>Celery, cresses, olives, radishes, and relishes of that kind
are, of course, to be eaten with the fingers; the salt should be
laid upon one's plate, not upon the cloth. Fish is to be eaten with
the fork, without the assistance of the knife; a bit of bread in
the left hand sometimes helps one to master a refractory morsel.
Fresh fruit should be eaten with a silver-bladed knife, especially
pears, apples, etc.</p>
<p>Berries, of course, are to be eaten with a spoon. In England
they are served with their hulls on, and three or four are
considered an ample quantity. But then in England they are many
times the size of ours; there they take the big berry by the stem,
dip into powdered sugar, and eat it as we do the turnip radish. It
is not proper to drink with a spoon in the cup; nor should one,
by-the-way, ever quite drain a cup or glass.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 598]</span><a name='Page_598' id=
"Page_598"></a>
<p>Don't, when you drink, elevate your glass as if you were going
to stand it inverted on your nose. Bring the glass perpendicularly
to the lips, and then lift it to a slight angle. Do this
easily.</p>
<p>Drink sparingly while eating. It is far better for the digestion
not to drink tea or coffee until the meal is finished. Drink
gently, and do not pour it down your throat like water turned out
of a pitcher.</p>
<p>When seating yourself at the table, unfold your napkin and lay
it across your lap in such a manner that it will not slide off upon
the floor; a gentleman should place it across his right knee. Do
not tuck it into your neck like a child's bib. For an old person,
however, it is well to attach the napkin to a napkin hook and slip
it into the vest or dress buttonholes, to protect their garments,
or sew a broad tape at two places on the napkin, and pass it over
the head. When the soup is eaten, wipe the mouth carefully with the
napkin, and use it to wipe the hands after meals. Finger bowls are
not a general institution, and yet they seem to be quite as needful
as the napkin, for the fingers are also liable to become a little
soiled in eating. They can be had quite cheaply, and should be
half-filled with water, and placed upon the side table or butler's
tray, with the dessert, bread and cheese, etc. They are passed to
each person half filled with water, placed on a parti-colored
napkin with a dessert plate underneath, when the dessert is placed
upon the table. A leaf or two of sweet verbena, an orange flower,
or a small slice of lemon, is usually put into each bowl to rub
upon the fingers. The slice of lemon is most commonly used. The
finger tips are slightly dipped into the bowl, the lemon juice is
squeezed upon them, and then they are dried softly upon the napkin.
At dinner parties and luncheons they are indispensable.</p>
<p>Spoons are sometimes used with firm puddings, but forks are the
better style. A spoon should never be turned over in the mouth.</p>
<p>Ladies have frequently an affected way of holding the knife
half-way down its length, as if it were too big for their little
hands; but this is as awkward a way as it is weak; the knife should
be grasped freely by the handle only, the forefinger being the only
one to touch the blade, and that only along the back of the blade
at its root, and no further down.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of a course, where they have been used, knife
and fork should be laid side by side across the middle of the
plate&mdash;never <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 599]</span><a name=
'Page_599' id="Page_599"></a>crossed; the old custom of crossing
them was in obedience to an ancient religious formula. The servant
should offer everything at the left of the guest, that the guest
may be at liberty to use the right hand. If one has been given a
napkin ring, it is necessary to fold one's napkin and use the ring;
otherwise the napkin should be left unfolded. One's teeth are not
to be picked at table; but if it is impossible to hinder it, it
should be done behind the napkin. One may pick a bone at the table,
but, as with corn, only one hand is allowed to touch it; yet one
can easily get enough from it with knife and fork, which is
certainly the more elegant way of doing; and to take her teeth to
it gives a lady the look of caring a little too much for the
pleasures of the table; one is, however, on no account to suck
one's finger after it.</p>
<p>Whenever there is any doubt as to the best way to do a thing, it
is wise to follow that which is the most rational, and that will
almost invariably be found to be proper etiquette. To be at ease is
a great step towards enjoying your own dinner, and making yourself
agreeable to the company. There is reason for everything in polite
usage; thus the reason why one does not blow a thing to cool it, is
not only that it is an inelegant and vulgar action intrinsically,
but because it may be offensive to others&mdash;cannot help being
so, indeed; and it, moreover implies, haste, which, whether from
greediness or a desire to get away, is equally objectionable.
Everything else may be as easily traced to its origin in the fit
and becoming.</p>
<p>If, to conclude, one seats one's self properly at table and
takes reason into account, one will do tolerably well. One must not
pull one's chair too closely to the table, for the natural result
of that is the inability to use one's knife and fork without
inconveniencing one's neighbor; the elbows are to be held well in
and close to one's side, which cannot be done if the chair is too
near the board. One must not lie or lean along the table, nor rest
one's arms upon it. Nor is one to touch any of the dishes; if a
member of the family, one can exercise all the duties of
hospitality through servants, and wherever there are servants,
neither family nor guests are to pass or help from any dish.
Finally, when rising from your chair leave it where it stands.</p>

<a name='DINNER_GIVING' id="DINNER_GIVING"></a>
<h2><b>DINNER GIVING.</b></h2>
<br>
<p><b>THE LAYING OF THE TABLE AND THE TREATMENT OF GUESTS.</b></p>
<p>In giving "dinners," the apparently trifling details are of
great importance when taken as a whole.</p>
<p>We gather around our board agreeable persons, and they pay us
and our dinner the courtesy of dressing for the occasion, and this
reunion should be a time of profit as well as pleasure. There are
certain established laws by which "dinner giving" is regulated in
polite society; and it may not be amiss to give a few observances
in relation to them. One of the first is that an invited guest
should arrive at the house of his host at least a quarter of an
hour before the time appointed for dinner. In laying the table for
dinner <i>all</i> the linen should be a spotless white throughout,
and underneath the linen tablecloth should be spread one of thick
cotton-flannel or baize, which gives the linen a heavier and finer
appearance, also deadening the sound of moving dishes. Large and
neatly folded napkins (ironed without starch), with pieces of bread
three or four inches long, placed between the folds, but not to
completely conceal it, are laid on each plate. An ornamental
centre-piece, or a vase filled with a few rare flowers, is put on
the centre of the table, in place of the large table-castor, which
has gone into disuse, and is rarely seen now on well-appointed
tables. A few choice flowers make a charming variety in the
appearance of even the most simply laid table, and a pleasing
variety at table is quite as essential to the enjoyment of the
repast as is a good choice of dishes, for the eye in fact should be
gratified as much as the palate.</p>
<p>All dishes should be arranged in harmony with the decorations of
the flowers, such as covers, relishes, confectionery, and small
sweets. Garnishing of dishes has also a great deal to do with the
appearance of a dinner-table, each dish garnished sufficiently to
be in good taste without looking absurd.</p>
<p>Beside each plate should be laid as many knives, forks and
spoons as will be required for the several courses, unless the
hostess prefers to have them brought on with each change. A glass
of water, and when wine is served glasses for it, and individual
salt-cellars may be placed at every plate. Water-bottles are now
much in vogue with <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 601]</span><a name=
'Page_601' id="Page_601"></a>corresponding tumblers to cover them;
these, accompanied with dishes of broken ice, may be arranged in
suitable places. When butter is served a special knife is used, and
that, with all other required service, may be left to the judgment
and taste of the hostess, in the proper placing of the various aids
to her guests' comfort.</p>
<p>The dessert plates should be set ready, each with a doily and a
finger-glass partly filled with water, in which is dropped a slice
of lemon; these with extra knives, forks and spoons, should be on
the side-board ready to be placed beside the guest between the
courses when required.</p>
<p>If preferred, the "dinner" may all be served from the
side-table, thus relieving the host from the task of carving. A
plate is set before each guest, and the dish carved is presented by
the waiter on the left-hand side of each guest. At the end of each
course the plates give way for those of the next. If not served
from the side-table, the dishes are brought in ready carved, and
placed before the host and hostess, then served and placed upon the
waiter's salver, to be laid by that attendant before the guest.</p>
<p>Soup and fish being the first course, plates of soup are usually
placed on the table before the dinner is announced; or if the
hostess wishes the soup served at the table, the soup-tureen,
containing <i>hot</i> soup, and the <i>warm</i> soup-plates are
placed before the seat of the hostess. Soup and fish being disposed
of, then come the joints or roasts, <i>entrees</i> (made dishes),
poultry, etc., also relishes.</p>
<p>After dishes have been passed that are required no more, such as
vegetables, hot sauces, etc., the dishes containing them may be set
upon the side-board, ready to be taken away.</p>
<p>Jellies and sauces, when not to be eaten as a dessert, should be
helped on the dinner-plate, not on a small side dish as was the
former usage.</p>
<p>If a dish be on the table, some parts of which are preferred to
others, according to the taste of the individuals, all should have
the opportunity of choice. The host will simply ask each one if he
has any preference for a particular part; if he replies in the
negative, you are not to repeat the question, nor insist that he
must have a preference.</p>
<p>Do not attempt to eulogize your dishes, or apologize that you
cannot recommend them&mdash;this is extreme bad taste; as also is
the vaunting of the excellence of your wines, etc., etc.</p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 602]</span><a name='Page_602' id=

<p>Do not insist upon your guests partaking of particular dishes.
Do not ask persons more than once, and never force a supply upon
their plates. It is ill-bred, though common, to press any one to
eat; and, moreover, it is a great annoyance to many.</p>
<p>In winter, plates should always be warmed, but not made hot. Two
kinds of animal food, or two kinds of dessert, should not be eaten
<i>off</i> of one plate, and there should never be more than two
kinds of vegetables with one course. Asparagus, green corn,
cauliflower and raw tomatoes comprise one course in place of a
salad. All meats should be cut across the grain in very thin
slices. Fish, at dinner, should be baked or boiled, never fried or
broiled. Baked ham may be used in every course after fish, sliced
thin and handed after the regular course is disposed of.</p>
<p>The hostess should retain her plate, knife and fork, until her
guests have finished.</p>
<p>The crumb-brush is not used until the preparation for bringing
in the dessert; then all the glasses are removed, except the
flowers, the water-tumblers, and the glass of wine which the guest
wishes to retain with his dessert. The dessert plate containing the
finger-bowl, also a dessert knife and fork, should then be set
before each guest, who at once removes the finger-bowl and its
doily, and the knife and fork to the table, leaving the plate ready
to be used for any dessert chosen.</p>
<p>Finely sifted sugar should always be placed upon the table to be
used with puddings, pies, fruit, etc., and if cream is required,
let it stand by the dish it is to be served with.</p>
<p>To lay a dessert for a small entertainment and a few guests
outside of the family, it may consist simply of two dishes of fresh
fruit in season, two of dried fruits and two each of cakes and
nuts.</p>
<p>Coffee and tea are served <i>lastly</i>, poured into tiny cups
and served clear, passed around on a tray to each guest, then the
sugar and cream passed that each person may be allowed to season
his black coffee or <i>caf&eacute; noir</i> to suit himself.</p>
<p>A <i>family dinner</i>, even with a few friends, can be made
quite attractive and satisfactory without much display or expense;
consisting first of good soup, then fish garnished with suitable
additions, followed by a roast; then vegetables and some made
dishes, a salad, crackers, cheese and olives, then dessert. This
sensible meal, well cooked and neatly served, is pleasing to almost
any one, and is within the means of any housekeeper in ordinary
circumstances.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
